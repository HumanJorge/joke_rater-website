ui391j,"Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp. Part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there's a long break in the ledge they can't cross. ""Something for this I have."" Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape. He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across. When they get back to Yoda's hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda's garden. ""Something I have for this."" Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole. Yoda and Luke return to Yoda's home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He's used all his forks but one, he discovers. ""That's ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. ""I'll write us a note reminding us to buy more."" So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board. He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror. ""Master Yoda!"" he asks.

vhnj6x,"The problem with mayflies (Long) Pets are something else. Sentient things you feed and house in exchange for some measure of comfort in an otherwise brief and unforgiving existence. They're like children, if children didn't grow up and learn to bitch about you on twitter. Which is why I decided to get a pet. Headed down to the rescue to see if I was ready to adopt an animal. At the rescue, it dawned on me that I had no idea how long these creatures lived. So I asked the guy showing me the animals, and he said some cats can live upto 20 years. 20 years. I'm supposed to keep a living being alive for 20 years! Even my parents sent me off to college at 17. Man, I couldn't even keep my hopes and dreams alive for that long, and I didn't need to get insurance for those. No wait, I did get insurance for my hopes and dreams. That's what college was. I decided to start small, which is how I came to have a Mayfly companion. If any of you don't know, mayflies are these really unique insects that only stay alive for a day, kinda like someone with glasses in a zombie apocalypse. Anyway, a day seems like a reasonable duration of time to gauge whether I'm a regular guy or some sort of deathly spectre whose touch turns everything to shit. I christened my companion Jerry. My time with Jerry was brief but I loved every second, all 86,400 of them. Except towards lunch when Jerry had a midlife crisis and tried to bang a Junefly. Apart from that it was kinda uneventful. Sadly, all we did was stay in because I didn't know how to keep him from leaving me if we went outside, which is generally the problem you face with any kind of captive. As midnight neared, I braced myself for the inevitable. I didn't want Jerry to die alone, in a strange place, made decrepit and feeble by old age. So I took him back to his roots a little brook that lazily meandered its way towards bigger things and I said my goodbyes. I miss Jerry. I really do. But I learned that it sucks to have a mayfly. You must be wondering why I think that. It sucks to have a mayfly because it gets old really fast.",0.39,Dark Humor,Relationships Jokes,6.0,0.75,2.5,1.0

Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries. Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note.

""You see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!"" ""And Is THAT when you swore?"" asks the amazed elder nun. ""No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."" ""Did you swear THEN?"" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient. ""No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap, rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."" The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed and said, ""You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?",0.49,One-liner Humor,Religious Jokes,30.0,0.86,3.6,5.0

So I go over, and he explains what to feed it and when. How to keep the tank clean, keeping it stimulated, those kinds of things. And then he hands me a spade and says that the octopus has a habit of escaping the tank, and I'd need the spade to get it back in the tank. No problem then. My friend goes away, and the next day I go to his house and prepare some food and toys. Just as I'm leaving, I hear a noise and see the octopus has escaped, and since he has a wooden floor, the octopus has suctioned itself to the floor. Remembering my friend's advice, I grab the spade and start scraping the tentacles off the floor. Let me tell you it was hard work, you get a couple tentacles up and when you go to do the next one, one would slide off the spade and stick back to the floor. Anyway, I perservere for a good hour and eventually get the octopus back in the tank and make sure it's all closed up. I go back the next day to feed it more and see it's escaped again. So I quickly throw the food in the tank and start the fight with the octopus. I can't believe my friend has to put up with this on a daily basis but I crack on until I hear a noise at the front door. My friend has returned early and seeing my car outside, shouts hello as enters the house and comes looking for me. He comes into the room with the tank and shouts at me ""what are you doing?!"", and not trying to sound sarcastic I tell him I'm trying to get the octopus back in the tank. He grabs the spade off of me and goes ""not like that you idiot, watch"" as he raises the spade in preparation to hit the octopus.

wtjebr,"Now, everyone always says timing is important; we'll get to that, the timing is usually in the punchline. First you need a premise - it can be simple. A ball. That's the focus. Some of you are already chuckling because your immature sense of humor has made its own connections with the word 'ball'; if the joke was simply ""Balls."" a few of you would laugh anyway because this was funny to you in the past, whether it was an in-joke with friends or because of the borderline-vulgar-but-tame, shit-children-say sort of word you don't say aloud with much conviction.

Why is the ball, when is the ball.. for example; ""Why did the ball fall down the hill?"" Now we have the 'setup'. We start to think about what the answer could be. There's an obvious answer, but it isn't the 'funny' answer.. some twist has to be involved, whether it's unexpected or just something extremely obvious but in the form of a pun or wordplay, in order to evoke a response in the recipient. When you write the punchline, it's generally recommended that the 'answer' be within realm of the expectations of the recipient or it might not make any sense to them. If a reference is too obscure it will result in confusion, so it's best to stay within general subject matter in order for the listener to relate to the joke. Anyway, I guess you thought I was going to tell you how to write a funny joke.. sorry about the misdirection. Balls.",0.35,Dark Humor,Bar Jokes,26.0,0.96,4.6,2.0

vbdfcm,"Oof. This one's good Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange. When the waiter brought our water and cutlery, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets. When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, ""Why the spoon?"" ""Well, ""he explained, ""the restaurant's owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."" As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""I'll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter's zip on his trousers. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, ""Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?"" ""Oh, certainly!"" Then he lowered his voice. ""Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent."" I asked ""After you get it out, how do you put it back?"" ""Well,"" he whispered, ""I don't know about the others, but I use the spoon.""",0.44,Pun Humor,Technology Jokes,10.0,0.78,2.8000000000000007,6.0

wn2u4b,"Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them dearly, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat explosive effect on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, ""she'll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this,"" so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Shortly afterward, they were married. A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down. Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill effects before he got home. So he went in, ordered, and had 3 extra large helpings of delicious baked beans. He farted all the way home. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, ""Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!"" She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peek. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but also ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and RRIIIPPPP!!! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. Then he got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table fell over. While keeping an ear tuned in on the conversation in the hallway, and keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this for the next ten minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin. When he heard the phone farewells he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, ""SURPRISE!!!""

uo8ors,"It's the eighteenth century and a ship is heading into port after a long voyage. Because it's the age of piracy, the ship was damaged and many seamen lost their lives. A captain steps out of the boat and heads into the port pub. There he asks, if there is anyone who would sail with him into his next voyage, that he lost a lot of people and that he has a really good deal lined up. A few people join him, but that's not enough. So he asks if anyone knows about someone who would be willing to sail with him. One sailor stands up and says: ""Captain, if you want any good lad, go there onto the wharf, there sits a man there who's spreading his bread with some sort of paste and is eating it, his name is Gluggle, so tell him, he'll go with you..."" So the captain heads onto the wharf and there's actually some man there, who's spreading paste over his bread and eating it. The captain tells him: ""You're Gluggle?"" Gluggle responds: ""Ayy,"" while he's eating his bread spread with paste. The captain says: ""You see, I'm searching for sailors who would go with me onto the ship, and someone told me that you would agree."" Gluggle is still spreading his breads and eating them and responds: ""Captain, sure, but I want one thing from you..."" while he's chipping away at his bread with paste. The captain says: ""Anything if you go with me"" Gluggle eats a piece of his bread spread with paste and says with a full mouth: ""Well, the only thing I want is to take some bread with paste with me."" The captain says: ""Sure, take that. So it's settled."" Gluggle loaded around three hundred breads and four barrels of paste onto the ship and so the voyage began. The weather is pretty good, the sailors aren't complaining, only Gluggle is sitting down in the below deck, spreading paste over breads, eating them and nothing interests him. But, what does not happen - a storm comes and damages the ship, so each sailor has to work like two. Gluggle isn't interested in any of this and is spreading his paste over the breads and is happy... The sailors start to murmur, that Gluggle isn't doing anything, so he needs to get out of the ship, so the captain goes into the lower decks and tells Gluggle: ""Hey Gluggle, I took you onto the ship and allowed you to take these breads and paste of yours. Thing is, there was a storm outside and our ship is damaged, so start doing something or we'll throw you out of the ship..."" Gluggle is spreading paste over his bread, eating it and responds: ""Alright captain, get me some wood, chisels, a saw, a hammer and some nails and you'll see what happens..."" The captain is looking at Gluggle, still eating his bread spread with paste, surprised and says: ""Gluggle, I have a sense of humor but this is a little too much. I'll have it given to you, but if nothing happens, you're immediately going out of the ship..."" Gluggle is eating his bread spread with paste and agrees with a nod of his head. Some sailor brings everything Gluggle wanted to him and Gluggle sits a day in the below deck, from which sounds of cutting, hammering and other woodwork is heard and after the day he goes onto deck with a box that has three holes on top and two on the bottom and tells the captain while eating bread with paste: ""Here you have a glugglebox, attach it to the fore of the ship and you'll see, what happens."" The captain says: ""Gluggle, you've got to be kidding me, I'm really willing to throw you out of the ship, but because I'm curious, I'll give you a last chance,"" and puts the glugglebox onto the fore. Gluggle returns into the deck, spreads his breads with paste and eats them. Suddenly, a Russian ship passes by, and the captain of the ship takes his binoculars and looks at Gluggle's ship. He focuses the lens and suddenly shouts: ""Jaka krasnaja glugglebox!!!"" The Russians immediately slammed against Gluggle's ship and offered thousands of rubbles for the glugglebox. The captain is suprised, but immediately regains his senses and sells the glugglebox. All the sailors are happy, only Gluggle doesn't care, he's sitting in the lower deck, spreading paste over his bread and eating them. Then a second and much stronger storm comes, breaks one pole, and a few sailors fall to their deaths. Everyone has to work as three men, only Gluggle is sitting in the below deck, spreading paste, which is starting to go a bit sour, over his breads and eating them. The sailors, of course, start to murmur and the captain goes to Gluggle once again and their conversation repeats. Gluggle is spreading paste over his breads and eating them, the captain explains to him that he has to do something and so on. Gluggle bites a piece of bread spread with paste off and says: ""Alright captain, give me even more wood than before, nails, a saw, a hammer, a plane, a chisel and whatever else you can think of, and you'll see what happens..."" The captain responds: ""Gluggle, once it actually worked, but that was a goddamn fluke, so I advice you, to not make fun of me..."" But he still brings him everything. Gluggle works hard for three days in the below deck, cuts with the saw, hammers the nails, planes, and so on until, finally, while eating bread spread with paste, he carries out a box two times as big and tells the captain: ""Attach this to the fore of the ship and you'll see what will happen."" The captain doesn't trust the eating Gluggle, but he still attaches the glugglebox onto the fore... Suddenly, a German ship passes by. The German captain is looking through the binoculars onto Gluggle's ship, then he focuses on the fore and shouts: ""Ach, eine schone glokglbox, die muss ich haben..."" and slams the ship. The German captain offers tens of thousands of marks and Gluggle's ship of course accepts the offer. Everyone is celebrating, all the sailors now have what to live off for a year, only Gluggle is sitting in the below deck, spreading his breads with sour paste and eating them, like nothing happened... Then Gluggle's ship encounters pirates. They fight for a long time, until they finally fend off the pirates, but they lose a lot of seamen and the ship is very devastated. Every sailor now works as five men. Gluggle is sitting in the below deck and spreads fermented paste over his rotting breads and eating them. The sailors, although they recognise Gluggle for everything he has done to them, they are aware that it all will be in vain if they don't arrive at a port. The captain goes into the below deck and with a tear in his eye tells Gluggle, who is still eating green bread spread with stinking fermented paste: ""You know, Gluggle, you've done so much for us, we have so much cash now, but, you see, pirates washed over us and everyone is working on the ship, you must also join the efforts, or we will have to forget about your good deeds and throw you into the see, morale must still exist..."" Gluggle, looking bored, is eating green bread spread with fermented paste and says: ""Alright, captain, give me three times as much wood than before, a saw, a plane, some nails, a hammer, chisels and a drill and whatever else you think of."" The captain orders the sailors to bring everything to Gluggle. The whole week, sounds of a woodworking saw, banging of a hammer, cutting and so on can be heard. After the week, Gluggle walks onto deck and gathers three sailors to help him carry the new, much bigger box, that has ten holes on the top and five on the bottom and hands it to the captain with the words: ""Attach it to the fore and you'll see, what will happen."" The captain puts the glugglebox on the fore and Gluggle goes into the below deck, takes his breads, spreads them with paste and starts eating them. After a while, a Spanish ship is sailing nearby. The captain is watching Gluggle's ship, but suddenly he notices the glugglebox on the fore, and with an almost orgasmic state he yells: ""Oh, que caja tan bonita, debe ser mia!"" The Spanish ship slams against Gluggle's and its sailors start literally shoveling cash over, after which they take the glugglebox and sail off happily. Everyone on Gluggle's ship are overjoyed, they don't have to work a single day the rest of their lives, only Gluggle is in the below deck, spreading his disgusting dark green breads with thirty percent paste and eating it. In the end, the ship arrives at port and the captain goes to Gluggle, who is spreading thirty percent paste over green rot and eating it, and tells him: ""Gluggle, by the name of the whole crew, I thank you for what you have done, we'll not forget it for the rest of our lives... But could I please ask you something? Could you please also make me a glugglebox as a commemoration?"" Gluggle eats a piece of rotting matter and says: ""Sure captain, I will, bring me all the wood you have on board, a whole lot of tools, nails, bolts and so on..."" The captain brings him everything and leaves him to work. Gluggle works tirelessly for two weeks, after which he gets out and calls for the whole cew to help him carry the captain's glugglebox. The sailors bring out a huge box that has twenty holes on top and ten on the bottom. The captain walks around it for a bit, after which he asks Gluggle, who is eating green rot with a white liquid: ""You know, Gluggle, you are very kind that you did this for me, but, don't get offended, what is it actually for?"" And Gluggle responds: ""Well, throw it into the water, and you'll see what will happen."" The captain says: ""But Gluggle, do you know how much money it costs? I could buy a half of this port for this..."" But Gluggle responds: ""Throw it into the sea, and you'll see what will happen!"" The captain hesitates for a bit, but then he lets the crew take the glugglebox and throw it into the sea. The glugglebox lands on the water surface and then a sound can be heard: ""Glug, glug, glug...""",0.33,Cultural Humor,Relationships Jokes,6.0,0.71,2.1,2.0

ucpwj6,"A woman visited an Amazonian tribe on a research trip... She spent several days taking notes on the lifestyle and habits of the tribe and interviewing their ruler, King Paolo, via an interpreter. As the tribe's land was near several rich gold mines, the king and his people were extremely wealthy. During the woman's time with him, the king fell hopelessly in love with her, as she was very beautiful. When it came time for her to leave to return to the United States, the king called her into his palace and spoke passionately to her via the interpreter. ""King Paolo begs you to remain here and be his wife. He will grant you any three requests within his power; whatever you ask will be yours."" Flattered but not desiring to remain in the Amazon forever, the woman decided to ask for impossible favors to avoid having to turn the king down and hurt his feelings. ""Tell the king that I accept, but if he cannot fulfill my three requests, I must leave immediately. My first wish is for a 50-carat diamond engagement ring and 25-carat bracelets and necklaces to match."" When the request was relayed to him, the king nodded without hesitation and responded in primitive English: ""Okay, okay! I buy, I buy!"" The woman frowned, not expecting the king to be able to fulfill the ask. She decided to make the next request truly impossible: ""My second wish is to live in a home exactly like this one."" She pulled up her phone and displayed a picture of a nine-figure Beverly Hills mansion with three pools, gatehouses, acres of perfectly landscaped property, indoor basketball courts and theatre rooms, the whole nine yards. When the interpreter explained the request to the king, he waved his hand and nodded eagerly. ""Okay, okay, I build! I build!"" He motioned to his nearby advisors, who immediately contacted the finest architects in Brazil to consult on the project. In exchange for several tons of gold, the architects designed an identical residence and brought in several construction companies to begin work immediately. They brought in solar panels and hydroelectric units to power the buildings. Paying triple the usual rate, the king had land cleared and construction completed within days. It was some real Extreme Makeover: Home Dumbfounded and a bit concerned, as she still had no desire to remain in the rainforest for the rest of her life, the woman went before the king with her final request, determined to come up with something that no amount of money could provide. ""Tell the king that the man I marry must have a penis that's 12 inches long."" Looking horrified, King Paolo arose from his throne and strode around the room muttering to himself, first angrily and then sadly. He seemed to be thinking desperately, searching for options. But finally, he shook his head sadly, and spoke in a tone of resignation: ""Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.""",0.51,Sexual Humor,Technology Jokes,5.0,0.62,1.2000000000000002,2.0

For example, if he stayed quiet for a whole year, the next year he could say TWO words and so on. This prince then met a stunning young woman whom he developed a longing for. All he wished for was to hold her hand, look her in her eyes and say, ""My darling"".

vj9ib8,"A Mexican, a Spaniard and an American are all travelling in a plane When suddenly, the plane crashed onto a small island. The three emerged from the crash remains and noticed they're the only survivors. They quickly organized and started gathering materials to survive when suddenly, a group of native cannibals surrounded them with spears and took them to the village chief. The chief then told them that in order to survive and avoid being eaten, they'll have to complete a task that is split in two parts. The chief says: The first part consists of grabbing one of these baskets and bringing 10 units of your desired fruit. Once you come back, I'll explain the second part of the test. And so, the 3 survivors each grab as basket and run off separately across the jungle. After a while, the first one to arrive is the American, as he approaches the chief, he kneeled in one knee and offered up his basket as he said: ""Chief, I have returned. My name is George and I have brought 10 apples"". ""Great!"" Says the chief. ""Now what I want you to do George is to grab each one of those apples and stick em up your ass, and if you happen to make ANY sort of noise whilst doing it, we will kill you immediately"". George nods nervously and starts sweating as he drops his pants down. He started cursing his own mind for picking apples instead of a smaller fruit. The cannibals gathered around him forming a circle as he put on his best poker face and gritted his teeth as he shoved the first apple up his rectum, the pain was eventually too much and he let out a scream in pain, the cannibals slit his troath on the spot. Right as this was happening, the Mexican survivor arrived. He approached the chief and offered his basket and said ""My name is Juan and I've brought 10 cherries"". The chief explains the same rules as he told George before, the Mexican feeling wise and cocky thought to himself ""Piece of cake!"" He dropped his trousers and the cannibals gathered around Juan as he started his endeavour. One after another, the cherries magically disappeared inside this man's body all the while he is remaining completely silent almost bragging about his cherry inserting skills. As the cherries disappeared, the cannibals got excited and started chanting something in their native language akin to how you would chant ""Chug! Chug! Chug!"" as words of encouragement to your drunk friend. The Mexican, feeling proud and accomplished, held the last cherry in his hand, he looked to the left and held the cherry in the air, all the cannibals going crazy in excitement. He looked to the right and he couldn't hold it, he laughed! He let out a hysterical laugh, unable to stop! The cannibals slit his troath as he wasn't supposed to make ANY kind of noise. On their way to heaven, George saw Juan and said to him very angrily: ""Juan! You stupid dumbf***! I saw it all. You had it man! One more cherry and you could still be alive! What the hell happened?!"" The Mexican, still giggling said: I know, I know George. I couldn't help myself.

It made him a significant amount of money but people complained about being a little too agitated by them. He followed up with a heavily alcoholic variety, which was very well received and made him millions, but which had the unfortunate effect of being too effective at sedating the users.

On the third hole, he scored his first-ever hole-in-one, and just as he began celebrating his cell phone rang It was a doctor in the local ER notifying him that his wife had just been in a car accident and was in the ICU The man told the doctor he was on the golf course and that he'd be there right away. After he ended the call he realized that he was cutting short what was shaping up to be his best round of golf ever, so he decided to get in a couple more holes before heading to the hospital He ended up playing all eighteen, finishing his round shooting a personal best 61, beating his previous best by more than 10, and shattering the club record by five strokes.

""Well, I hope you're proud of yourself because while you were out for the past four hours having a grand ole time at the country club, your wife has been laboring in the ICU, fighting for her life"" After pausing for a moment the doctor continued, ""Well, I guess it's just as well you went ahead and finished your round because more than likely it'll be the last one you'll ever play"" ""Why?"" the man asked, not exactly sure what the doctor meant ""Because for the rest of your life your wife will require round-the-clock care.

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it."" The old farmer Peter replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here."" The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial lawyers in Canada and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own."" The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we settle disputes in Alberta. We settle small disagreements like this with the 'Three Kick Rule.' The lawyer asked, ""What is the 'Three Kick Rule'?"" The Farmer replied, ""Well, because the dispute occurs on my land, I get to go first. I kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up."" The lawyer quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the attorney. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy steel-toed work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees! His second kick to the midriff sent the lawyer's last meal gushing from his mouth. The lawyer was on all fours when the farmer's third kick to his rear end, sent him face-first into a fresh cow pie. Summoning every bit of his will and remaining strength the lawyer very slowly managed to get to his feet. Wiping his face with the arm of his jacket, he said, ""Okay, you old fart.

wn6wkc,"Chief Weatherman The Indians on a remote reservation in Oklahoma asked their new chief if the coming winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was a chief in modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets. When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he told his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. But, being a practical leader, after several days, he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?' 'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold,' the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. 'Does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?' 'Yes,' the man at National Weather Service again replied, 'it's going to be a very cold winter.' The chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. Two weeks later, the chief called the National Weather Service again. 'Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?' 'Absolutely,' the man replied. 'It's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters we've ever seen.' 'How can you be so sure?' the chief asked. The weatherman replied, 'The Indians are collecting a shitload of firewood'",0.63,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,5.0,0.73,2.3,2.0

But time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point. More personal information. What firm she worked for. Where my farm was. Names of relatives. Names of high schools. All the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough. But, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures. Until one day I got a message from her: ""I never thought I'd say this, but I really do want to meet you in person. I think we have a rare connection, and I don't want to squander it. I want to send you my picture, and I want you to send me yours, but I'm telling you, I can never date a beekeeper."" I couldn't imagine a life without my bees.

He'd run the Boston Marathon, was an avid surfer, and climbed Everest, but he'd started to have abdominal pains around his 85th birthday and went to see a doctor. Sadly, he ultimately was diagnosed with a rare degenerative liver disease that slowly made him allergic to everything he ate. He kept copious notes, and as an avid gastronomist slowly grew to despair as everything he'd spent his life enjoying became something he could no longer eat. Alcohol went first, then mushrooms, then bread, then root vegetables, then coffee, one at a time he had to remove them from his diet. The doctor was clear: if he kept eating something his liver rejected the autoimmune response would be quick and severe, and would lead to a painful death. Little by little, everything was taken away as an option, until the only thing that remained was milk. In some ways, this actually made life easier, because the mental strain of remembering what he could and couldn't eat was gone, but then so was the joy in variety. But he took it in stride, and got his own cow and took classes from a farmer to learn everything he could about the only thing that could give him sustenance. And even within milk, he could still have yogurt, butter, cream, some cheeses, and other milk-derived products he hadn't fully rejected yet, so it wasn't all bad. But then one day a few months later he felt the pain again, and he knew cow's milk was no longer an option. Lacking other options, he tried goat's milk, and he was delighted that it worked! The protein structure is just different enough that his body still tolerated it. That bought him another month. And that's when we came up with a wonderful plan to go on one last grand adventure around the world. If he could get one month of life out of the milk of every mammal, he'd actually have a few more years to enjoy life to the fullest and see the world in all its beauty. Each month, we'd pick a place with a new mammal, and he would immerse himself fully with the locals, learn all the ways to prepare the milk, and just enjoy the hand he had been dealt as much as he could. We milked sheep in New Zealand. Camels in Egypt. Zebras in South Africa. Giant bats in Indonesia. Do you know how many Peruvian cuy you need to milk to get a single glass? I do. Even as his health slowly faded, he stayed cheerful, and I felt lucky to join him on the adventure of a lifetime. That brings us to today when he got to the very end of his spreadsheet, and declared that he was now allergic to every mammal. He'd enjoyed his journey, but his time had come to an end, for there was nothing left to milk. To which I said nonsense, I bet we can milk a few thousand karma out of this post.",0.43,Cultural Humor,Relationships Jokes,4.0,0.57,0.6999999999999993,6.0

wp44qm,"[Long] An ex-CIA operative named Arti had a younger sister always getting into mischief... Arti's sister was beautiful, you see. She would use her looks to get things she wanted, but when she got in over her head, she'd always fall back on big brother Arti's special set of skills to help her out. And since he retired early (after becoming partially disabled saving the President's life from a would-be assassin), he always ended up helping her/enabling more exploits. One day, his sister met an 80-year old billionaire and began dating him hoping to cash in from his Will when he croaks (""hopefully soon"" as she put it). She told Arti this on the phone and he immediately becomes wary. ""Sis, you know this is a bad idea. Once again, you don't know what you're getting yourself into!"" She blows him off, enjoying her 5-star hotels and private jets, and then the big day came - the old geezer proposed with a diamond the size of a ring pop. She enthusiastically said ""Yes!"" and they married on his private island in the Pacific. It was a ridiculous sight - a slumping, 80-year old magnate and his beautiful, dolled-up bride, 50 years his junior. But things change very quickly. Before the marriage, she was living lavishly - using his platinum credit card to her heart's desire, driving luxury cars (or better yet, being chauffeured), and traveling the world in style. But after the honeymoon, the geriatric fat-cat laid down some rules for his wife - a $5k monthly LIMIT on the platinum card, ONE international trip per year, chauffer only on WEEKENDS, and more - it was too much for her to bear. And even worse, his health was seemingly improving! He was always bragging about his perfect health report from his doctor and even running 5ks and swimming laps in their indoor pool. He had top-of-the-line medical professionals and physical therapists on call 24/7 for any slight deficiency or physical malady. ""I can't die! My work is too important!"" he would joke, but his wife started to think it was true. After a year of this, Arti's sister called him up. ""Brother, I can't take this anymore. He tracks me everywhere I go, limits my spending, I can't even have my girlfriends over to our private cocktail bar! I feel like a prisoner. You have to help me..."" ""And what do you propose, oh genius sister of mine?"" Arti replied sarcastically, having heard this plea many times before. The phone went silent. ""Arti I...I need you to kill him."" Arti hung up. He wouldn't entertain this. But his sister was desperate. She called back repeatedly and insisted on her demand, pestering him for months. ""If you kill him, I'll give you any sum you need to leave the country, form a new identity, live on a remote island - anything you need! The Will is going to make me a fortune enough for both of us!"" After months of thinking, Arti once again failed to say no to his helpless sister. He agreed to one last assassination, then he was done helping her for good. He began tracking the old man's routine, following his entourage discreetly trying to find the best method to take out the businessman. He discovered there was ONE occasion when he was all alone - each week, there was an Amish farmer's market he would go to anonymously to take in some privacy and brush shoulders with the common folk. There were lots of stalls and trailers and carts that obscured everyone's view. With his fiber wire, a well-timed strangulation would take less than a minute and he could walk away in the crowd, home free. Then the day came. He followed the old man through the farmer's market, ensuring no guards were with him. Then, after a half hour or so, the old man turned a corner toward the edge of the market and Arti's heart began racing. He couldn't believe his luck - the old man...was going to take a piss! He intentionally walked to a place out-of-view to relieve himself and Arti took his chance. His fiber wire was around the old man's neck one second, and the job was done. His arteries had been severed and he bled out before he suffocated. Arti turned to make his getaway in the blended crowd and froze - a man with an armful of corn was staring at him - a witness. Arti had no choice. He lunged forward with his fiber wire and strangled the life out of the witness as well - but not before the victim was able to let out a warning scream and attract attention. The plan failed. Arti tried running away, but his escape was foiled due to his partial disability and he was in police custody within the hour. To make a bad situation even worse, the old man was never planning on making his sister a rich widow - she found a hidden copy in his safe, which read, ""to my selfish wife: I've always seen through your cold, material heart, and to teach you a lesson, I leave you $1.00."" A billionaire and a blameless bystander - dead for so little. While the plotting widow would eventually become infamous, initial reports focused solely on the double-murder, as summed up in one newspaper headline: ""At the Farmer's Market, Arti Chokes Two for $1.00""",0.4,One-liner Humor,Celebrity Jokes,6.0,0.75,2.5,1.0

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed.

John said, seemingly unworried. ""Of course, but you must promise to never tell anyone what was inside,"" the man whispered, suddenly quiet. The man pulled back one clasp slowly.

Guest: Sorry but not really following a long string and a pocket full of spoons as saving time"" The server kind of laughs and proceeds to explain.

So they had us tie this string around our dicks so we could just go to the bathroom and pull the string to go pee. That way we save time by never touching it and not needed to wash our hands"" The guest kind of still looks a bit confused and says, ""Ok i mean i guess that makes sense, but i guess i was wondering, if you don't touch it? How do you get 'it' back in?"" The server just kind of smiles and says, ""Well not sure about anyone else, but i just use my spoons!""",0.35,Pun Humor,Technology Jokes,107.0,0.97,4.699999999999999,3.0

x5jaze,"There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted. About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off. The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak. The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"". ""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist. ""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now."" The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life."" The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?"" The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free."" The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?"" The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide."" ""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom. Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance."" The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles. It's unbelievable. The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth. The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died."" The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",0.66,,,7.0,0.62,1.2000000000000002,18.0

x78ag6,"Engineer and an Academic on a plane An engineer is getting an 8 hour business flight and next to him sits an academic. The engineer is tired and had a crammed week of line side meetings, design meeting, improvement meetings etc. he just wants to get some sleep as its a night flight and he is back in the office in the morning, so forms his jacket into a pillow. The academic, not reading the room, starts chatting to the engineer. he is coming back from a conference. He explains his many successes like reigning champion on mastermind, countdown, his stature in mincer, his multiple degrees and PHD and how he was a guest speaker at the conference etc. the engineer is to polite to rebuff the academic so listens on. The academic askes the engineers highest qualification. The academic proposes a game 'to pass the time', the rules are they ask each other questions and if they cant answer they give the other some money. the academic rather crockery says due to the IQ difference he will give the engineer 50 if he cant answer his questions but the engineer only gives him 5 if he cant answer. The engineer pauses for a few seconds and then agrees. The academic opens with 'what is the diameter of the moon?' The engineer does not know, gets his wallet out and hands him 5. The academic gets his wallet out, whilst explaining with a hint of gloating it is 3474.8km in diameter, and put the 5 in, the engineer sees his wallet is full of 5 notes. The engineer then thinks for a second and says 'what goes up a hill forwards on 3 legs and down a hill backwards on 4 legs' The academic is stumped. his knowledge of animals is quite vast. His is a master of riddles but does not know this one and cant work it out off hand. A few minutes pass and the engineer says 'wake me if you think you have it' turns over and goes to sleep. The academic is racking his brains, trying to break it down and going over everything he can remember. He even flicks though the books he has in desperation. the hours pass and the academic racks his brains the whole time. The plane lands and when the engineer wakes the academic congratulates him, no one of his 'calibre' has ever beaten him at the game and begrudgingly gives him 50. As they are unloading the luggage the academic is looking at the engineer expectantly. As they are queuing to leave the academic says 'so, come on then, what is the answer to your question?'

wo5qd0,"A horse, a sheep, and a chicken lived together on a farm. The horse had long dreamed of learning to play the guitar. So the horse rings a music shop and he says, ""Hey, I'd love to learn to play guitar. Is there anyone who can teach me""? The music shop manager says ""That's not an issue, let's get you started on some music lessons."" The horse says ""Well there's one problem, sir, I'm actually a horse."" The music store manager says ""Hey, that's not a problem! I'm sure I can manage to teach you!"". The horse says ""Awesome!"" so he goes in to his lessons and in no time he's rockin' the whole farm with his guitar. One day the sheep comes wandering over. Sheep watches horse play for a bit and then says that he'd really like to learn to play drums, and can horse recommend anyone who can teach him? Horse gives sheep the number of the music shop, and sheep dials the number. The music store manager says ""Hey, no problem, I'll teach you to play drums! How about we set up some lessons?"" The sheep says, ""Is it going to be a problem if I'm a sheep?"" The manager says ""Not a problem! In fact, awhile ago I taught a horse to play guitar, so it shouldn't be too hard to teach a sheep to play drums!"". So the sheep goes for his music lessons and soon enough, he's mastered them and he and horse start jamming together in the stables. One morning sheep and horse are rocking the hose down when chicken struts past. Chicken is very impressed and tells horse and sheep that he's always wanted to learn to sing, and could horse or sheep recommend anyone? They both tell him about the music shop and the chicken decides to call the music shop. So he gives the shop a call and tells the manager that he's always longed to learn to sing, and could anyone help him? The shop manager says it's no problem, and when is he free to come in for lessons? Chicken says, ""There's just one small issue"". The shop manager asks, ""What's that?."" The chicken says, Well...I'm a chicken."" The manager says ""That's no problem, I've taught a horse to play guitar and a sheep to play drums, so I'm sure I can teach a chicken to sing"". So chicken takes his lessons and in no time at all he's the best singer you ever heard. He and sheep and horse decide to form a band, and start playing together, and even writing songs. One day they're smashing it out out in the stables when they decided to record a video of one of their songs and upload it to YouTube. The song ends up going viral. It's so popular they release more videos, and soon they have a massive fan base. They all decide it's time to embark on a world tour.

As horse is waiting for a new flight, he's watching TV and a news story tells him that the plane sheep and chicken were on crashed and both chicken and sheep tragically died. Horse was very upset about losing his two closest friends and decides to go into the bar across the road and get a drink to drown his sorrows.

wsa755,"Six Lessons **Lesson 1:** A man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. The wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob, the next door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, ""I'll give you $800 to drop that towel."" After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, ""Who was that?"" ""It was Bob the next door neighbour,"" she replies. ""Great!"" the husband says, ""Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?"" *Moral of the story:* If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure. **Lesson 2:** A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, ""I'll give each of you just one wish"" ""Me first! Me first!"" says the administration clerk. ""I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world."" Poof! She's gone. ""Me next! Me next!"" says the sales rep.

""OK, you're up,"" the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, ""I want those two back in the office after lunch."" *Moral of the story:* Always let your boss have the first say **Lesson 3:** A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,""Father, remember Psalm 129?"" The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, ""Father, remember Psalm 129?"" The priest apologized ""Sorry sister but the flesh is weak."" Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, ""Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."" *Moral of the story:* If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity **Lesson 4** A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?"" The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.

""Well, why don't you nibble on my droppings?"" replied the bull. ""They're packed with nutrients."" The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. *Moral of the story:* Bullshit might get you to the top, but it wont keep you there **Lesson 6** A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him. *Moral of the story:* 1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy 2.

ui94z5,"If Microsoft made cars. Disclaimer: This Joke was made in the 1990's in response to comments that if the automobile industry kept pace with Silicone Valley cars would be much more advanced. The origin is the Mid 1990's However at close retrospect some of this now happens. At a computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated that ""If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 mi/gal."" Recently General Motors addressed this comment by releasing the statement: ""Yes, but would you want your car to crash twice a day?"" **IF MICROSOFT BUILT CARS..** 1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car. 2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart and drive on. (various systems failing that work when you restart) 3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver would cause your car to stop and fail and you would have to re-install the engine. For some strange reason, you would accept this too. 4. You could only have one person in the car at a time unless you bought ""Car95"" or ""CarNT"". But, then you would have to buy more seats. (new subscription services to access certain features) 5. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt. 6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast, twice as easy to drive but would only run on 5 percent of the roads. 7. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to their cars, which would make their cars run much slower. 8. The oil, gas and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single ""general car default"" warning light. (I give you the Check engine light) 9. The airbag system would say ""are you sure?"" before going off. 10. If you were involved in a crash, you would have no idea what happened.",0.4,,,5.0,0.59,0.8999999999999995,1.0

Peter looks a bit puzzled, but the guy is nowhere to be seen. So Peter closes the gate, turns around and immediately hears another knock on the gate. He opens the gate. The same guy is standing there, saying: ""Hi, I'm the Hu"" and vanishes again. Peter goes back inside, closes the gate and the same thing happens again. Knock on the door, ""Hi, I'm the Hu"" and the guy vanishes. After a couple times Peter asks one of the guardian angels, what that is all about. And the Angel says: ""Don't worry, this guy is named Hubert. He is still lying down on the road, being reanimated"".",0.35,Pun Humor,Religious Jokes,29.0,0.84,3.4000000000000004,12.0

wvyn0g,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!' Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

ui612b,"Several churches were having problems with squirrels damaging their buildings. The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they should not interfere with God's divine will. At the Baptist church, the deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week, and soon ended up destroying the church. But the Catholic church came up with a more creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now the squirrels are only seen at Christmas and Easter. Not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue. They took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since.",0.67,One-liner Humor,Religious Jokes,21.0,0.9,4.0,2.0
vfij3o,"Jim and Ted were let go after 15 years working at the bra factory so they headed down to the local Employment office There they each filled out some forms. They both had worked the same quality assurance positions on the line down at the ""Over The Shoulder Boulder Holder Inc."". Afterwards they each met with a jobs counselor to try and find new employment they could embark on. As the final step they met individually with a benefits counselor to receive their unemployment stipend. Back in the lobby Jim asked Ted what his weekly check would be. Jim said he'd be receiving $500 a week until he had found commensurate employment. Ted said he would be getting $2k per week. Since both men had been doing identical jobs the last 15 years Jim was upset at the difference and insisted on being reinterviewed. Jim met with the counselor and asked why the huge difference in unemployment to which the counselor replied that Ted had a very technical and high demand job that could be expected to receive significantly more than a simple garment checker. Jim was understandably upset at this as both men had been working side by side and were more or less interchangeable. Jim tried to explain as much but the counselor looking at the forms said Ted had stated his former occupation as ""diesel fitter"", a job that was defined in the Employment & Labour Standards as being critical to installation and maintenance of fuel systems on an industrial scale, with significant training requirements and in high demand. ""Garment Checker"" was detailed as a basically entry level position and required no training and with a surplus of candidates. Jim sat back and said well, that's the problem right there, every brassiere that came down the line for Ted to check he would hold up to his own chest and say ""dese'll fit her"".",0.52,Cultural Humor,Technology Jokes,5.0,0.86,3.6,3.0

wdfy6s,"When Italy became a Catholic country, the Pope decreed that all Jews in the Vatican must convert or leave When they refused, the pope offered them a deal: He would have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community. If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy. If the pope won, they would have to convert or leave. The Jewish people picked their wisest rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, the rabbi spoke no Italian, and the pope spoke no Yiddish, so they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. The day of the debate, the pope and rabbi sat opposite each other. The pope raised three fingers. The rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the pope waved his hands around in the air. The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The rabbi pulled out an apple. With that the pope stood and declared that he was beaten. The rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay. Later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. The pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Holy Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me there is still only one God common to our beliefs. Then, I waved my hands around to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and water, to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He had beaten me at every move and I could not continue. He had an answer to everything. How could I continue with my decree after that?"" Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. ""First,"" said the rabbi, ""he said to me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews and I said to him that we were staying right here."" ""And then what?"" asked a woman. ""Who knows?"" said the Rabbi.

uitk9m,"A scary story for those of you whom use YouTube... It was late at night and I was feeling all alone. And watching those eerie channels at night always have a way to make me feel... not alone. Like some presence is there with me. But I'm not a chicken, so as always I decided to watch a Top 5 list of the scariest phantoms type of story. While watching, I began to notice after the second story that whatever the narrator was saying happened to the victim of the story... was happening to me. I started noticing things outside. A red Corvette with a dented front left fender; a strange and sickly looking man walking to my next door neighbor's house ""just asking for sugar""; a murder of crows flying by cawing in such a way it sounding like a screeching demon saying ""he is almost here""; a group of kids riding their bikes down the road really fast, like they were being chased. But... in the last story, the victim's phantom was a YouTube comment or who was in all of the comments. Every. Fucking. Where. And that comment or always said very specific things to the channel's comment section community that *EVERYBODY* remembered. I felt so freaked out I went surfing through the comments section to see if I could find the dude. But I couldn't. Then I heard 3 slow knocks on my door. I remembered someone saying in r/paranormal recently that if you hear three knocks or even taps, even if they're slow in cadence and seem separate, don't answer the door. Don't even acknowledge them. Or you'll invite them into your home. I might have a Phantom. But I don't believe in ghosts at all. So I answered. And there he was... Just Some Guy Without A Moustache. (This will only be funny if you surf the comment sections of whatever channels you watch. More than likely you'll see him. He has one very short video but close to 300k subs just bc he is everywhere. And no, this isn't an endorsement. Also, sorry for the shit post it you have never seen him.)",0.28,Dad Humor,Bar Jokes,25.0,0.84,3.4000000000000004,3.0

The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond. Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door! With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound...... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

wz8ycc,"When I was 13, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend with big tits. When I was 16, I got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, so I decided I needed a passionate girl with zest for life. In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything was an emergency; she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide. So I decided I needed a girl with stability. When I was 25, I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was totally predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided I needed a girl with some excitement. When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition. When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, so I married her. She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned. I am older and wiser now, and I am looking for a girl with big tits.",0.6,Dark Humor,Celebrity Jokes,2.0,0.56,0.6000000000000005,1.0

You see, his secret was during every post-plunder celebration, Captain Burgundy would send Harriet down to the cargo hold to retrieve several bottles of his best stolen rum to reward the crew. One spring after several months at sea, the ship became unexpectedly infested with rats, that quickly ate through the ship food stores. Concerned that crew rations would have to be cut, Captain Burgundy made an unexpected stop on a remote island called Domingo Blanco. ""Git yerself to ze exterminator an' fetch some rat poison, before all yer shipmates starve!"" he yelled at his first mate Jack. With a few gold pieces in hand, Jack took the first available rowboat, rowed off to shore, and returned an hour later with a case of bottles. ""Jolly job, first arr, mate! Now secure that there crate in the 'old an' shove off!"" Soon the ship found a new island to pillage and plunder, and the crew brought back enough booty for weeks at sea. Captain Burgundy was thrilled with the day's take and ordered a huge party after the sun went down. As usual, he sent Harriet down to the cargo hold to fetch his best rum for his crew. When she returned, she popped the cork and quickly flew around filling all the crew goblets. No more than 2 drunken songs later, the first of the crew began vomiting, screaming, and throwing themselves off the side of the ship. Alarmed at this spectacle, Captain Burgundy ordered his first mate to snatch the bottle from Harriet before any further damage was done. As expected, Rat Poison! Capt Burgundy flew into a rage and grabbed First Mate Jack by his puffy shirt collar, jerking him up to eye level: ""Ye fool! 'ow could ye do this!"" Jack, pleading for his life, exclaimed: ""I put it in our only cargo 'old! Right where ye told me!"" Captain Burgundy replied, ""Ye fool.

The reason that they had not been intimate was because she was very flat-chested. If he wished to cancel the wedding, it would be okay with her. The guy thought about it for a while and said he did not mind if she was flat, and sex is not the most important thing in a marriage. Several miles down the road, the guy turned to the girl and said that he also wanted to make a confession. He said that below his waist he was just like a baby, and if the girl wished to cancel the wedding, it'd be fine by him. The girl thought about it for a while and said that she did not mind and she also believed there were other things far more important in a marriage than sex.

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck. ""I'm a plasterer."" The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it. So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves. The same thing happens for two weeks. Then one day the circus comes to town. The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him ""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!"" ""Sounds marvellous,"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. ""Get him to give me a call."" So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says, ""Hey Mr. Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money."" ""I'm always looking for the next job,"" Says the duck. ""Where is it?"" ""At the circus,"" Says the barman. ""The circus?"" Repeats the duck. ""That's right,"" Replies the barman. ""The circus?"" The duck asks again. """"With the big tent?"" ""Yeah,"" the barman replies. ""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck. ""Of course,"" the barman replies. ""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck. ""That's right!"" says the barman. The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says... ^(wait for it...) >!""What the fuck would they want with a plasterer??!""!<",0.47,One-liner Humor,Animals Jokes,6.0,1.0,5.0,4.0

The rifle had been handmade by Antonio's father who founded the Rolle Carabiner Company after World War II. Ricardo cherished the rifle and he practiced with it often. One day, while at the shooting range, he met a beautiful English girl named Nev and they fell in love at first sight. In broken English he asked her out for coffee and she accepted. Though she spoke little Italian, and he spoke poor English, they laughed and talked for hours. She called him Ric and told him she was in town for one week to compete in the Milan Shooting Championships. Later, the two walked back to her hotel, only to find her father standing, infuriated, outside the on the sidewalk. He yelled at Ricardo, ""Stay away from my daughter!"" But Nev screamed ""No Daddy, I love him!"" The father said to her ""Go inside!"" He turned to Ricardo and said ""If I ever lay eyes on you again, you better have an expensive present to give my daughter, or I will never let her see you!"" Ricardo went home and was very sad because he just could not afford to buy Nev an expensive present. Then he realized what to do. He took his cherished Rolle rifle, wrapped it in beautiful paper and attached a huge bow. Early the next morning, he returned to the hotel and knocked on her door. The father answered, and seeing the package in Ricardo's hands, invited him in. Nev was still asleep in the next room. Ricardo pleaded with the father to let him speak to her and give her the present. The father eventually relented and opened his daughter's door and called her name softly. Nev woke and though still groggy, saw Ricardo's face and her heart soared. She said ""Ric Rolle? What do you have?""

After what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it.

Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left. At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road. The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyzer test.

He said to Kristian, ""I'm fed up with being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten all the time."" As he said this, a large mysterious Cod appeared and said, ""Your wish is granted!"" And believe it or not, with that Justin turned into a fearsome shark. Kristian was horrified and so immediately swam away as he was scared of being eaten by his old friend. As time went by, Justin found his new life as a shark to be boring and lonely. None of his old friends would let him get near them as they thought he would eat them and so they just swam away whenever he approached. It took a while, but eventually Justin realized that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. Then one day he was swimming all alone as usual when he saw the mysterious cod again. He thought it'd be better if he could go back to his old life so he swam to the cod and begged to be changed back. The cod worked his magic and suddenly Justin was a prawn once more. With tears of joy streaming down his cheeks Justin swam straight to Kristian's home. As he opened the coral gate, the happy memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, ""Kristian, it's me, Justin, your old friend. Come out and see me again."" Kristian replied, ""No way! You're a shark now and you'll just eat me. I'm not being tricked into being your dinner."" Justin shouted back ""No, I'm not a shark any more. That was the old me. I've changed... I've found Cod.

ulyiol,"Kansas [OC] Steven grew up in rural Kansas, but he always yearned for something bigger. Sadly, when he was 14, his mother died of cancer. Later that same year, his father Don, a truck driver, became legally blind and lost his job. Devastated by the loss of his wife and job, and too proud to beg, Don soon became an abusive alcoholic. He forced Steven to quit school, get a job and support the household. Steven's relationship with his father, which had always been distant, became a nightmare. He would work upwards of 60 hours a week, only to come home to get berated by his disconsolate and good-for-nothing father. Steven vowed he would escape. So on the day he turned 18, Steven left Kansas to seek his fortune in New York City. When Don realized that his son had abandoned him, he sank deeper into the bottle. He turned even more bitter. He stopped talking to anyone. Finally, about a week after he had emptied the fridge, he knew he had to do something to take care of himself. Although legally blind, Don could still make out shapes and movement, especially at a distance. He walked outside and patiently waited until he saw some vultures flying around. Before they could land, Don had strode over and stolen the dead raccoon they were circling. He brought it home and made it into a stew. Soon, this became a routine, with him collecting whatever dead animal that the vultures had spotted, then cooking it up on the stove. Don ate opossum, skunk, rabbit, snakesanything that the vultures could help him find. And this is how he lived for many years. In New York, it was quite a different story for Steven. Although he had quit school four years earlier, Steven was good at writing and was able to channel the feelings from his broken childhood into emotional stories. Soon, he was writing plays for Broadway and was the toast of the town. His acclaim spread far, and he bought a penthouse on Park Avenue, so high he could nearly touch the clouds. Yet something was missing. Despite all his successand all the suffering his father had put him throughSteven still felt a need to reconnect with his father. Every night, he would toss and turn, crying, regretful of the circumstances that separated him from his dad and eager to make amends. One day, Steven got into his car and drove nearly 20 hours straight until he found himself on his father's doorstep. When Don opened the door, a foul odor emanated from within. Heartbroken to see his father's lowly condition, Steven told him that he had finally come to make his peace. Don had very mixed emotions at his son's return. On the one hand, he was very happy to have Steven back. Yet on another, he was still angry and wanted to let Steven know how much he had made Don suffer. So without a word, Don walked over to the stove and poured a cup of soup. He picked up a used spoon and placed the meal firmly in Steven's hands. Upon seeing the dirty bowl and strange chunks of meat, Steven asked his father, ""What is this?"" To which his father replied, ""Carrion, my wayward son.

ucj3hr,"There was once, in a small town, a man named Don. One day Don was walking on top of a fence, and he slipped. When he slipped, the fence split him in half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half of Don survived! Each half got up, started hopping away, and essentially started living separate lives. The left half, more prone to rational thought, spent most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting gig. The right half, more creative, picked up painting, and taught pottery at the local community college. On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of Don at the same place. Indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening. Now one day, half a man walks into a bar. The left half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him. At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back. As the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02. The bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident. As it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""Whole Don here for just one minute!""",0.43,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,2.0,0.67,1.7000000000000002,1.0

Some months later, the colonel felt certain urges of his own that could not be supressed, try as he might. He ordered the sergeant to bring the camel to his quarters. Once there, the colonel set upon the beast with lusty vigor. After the deed was done, the colonel saw that the sergeant was still standing at attention in the doorway.

George Washington nearly had a heart-attack because of the current state of the two party system, Napoleon tried to conquer Europe once more, and Alfred Einstein became an avid redditer, amongst many other historic events. But out of all the crazy things happening because of time travel, the most unusual thing just happened to be the ancient Romans' obsession with modern rock. Julius Caesar, Brutus and the rest of the gang (the senate) would usually go to some kind of rock concert every weekend to fufill their obsession with good ol' rock N' Roll. All of them had become massive die-hard fans of the genre, especially Caesar. Everything from Rock, Metal, Heavy Metal, Pop Rock, Anthem Rock, Contemporary Rock, Alternate Rock, and the list goes on. However, most of the senate thought Caesar was way too overbearing, and seemed to steal the thunder of every show they went to. They could hardly listen to the music because of all the crazy Caesar fans everywhere. Because of this, they decided to go without him for once. That week, the senate and Brutus decided to make up random reasons why they couldn't go out with Caesar that weekend. ""Sorry I have to repair my phone."" ""My cat died."" ""I have a dentist appointment."" The excuses were endless. Eventually, after the 23rd call, Caesar just decided to call it a night. Although he would have been fine going alone, he didn't want his friends to feel left out. So he stayed home. The weekend rolled around, and the gang went off to their concert without Caesar for once, celebrating their effective (albeit unoriginal) plan. Whilst at the concert, Caesar called Brutus to ask him about an upcoming Olympic game in London. Brutus accidentally accepted the call. ""Hey Caesar, what's up?"" Brutus asked nervously. ""Uhh..."" Caesar was quiet for a moment. ""What's that? I- I thought you were busy watering your tomato plants? Where are you!?"" Caesar asked angrily as the sound of a roaring crowd and loud music were incredibly apparent within the call. ""It's not what it sounds like!"" He pleaded, trying to think of an explanation. Suddenly, ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" started at the worst possible time, and he knew there was no way to deny his treachery.

There he was warmly welcomed by his Russian counterpart, who wined and dined him and generally offered him the best hospitality that Russia could offer. On his last day, the Russian foreign minister took the African foreign minister into a room with a table on which lay a revolver. ""My comrade, since you are about to leave, I must introduce you to a custom we have here in Russia, something called Russian roulette. It is a true test of manhood and worth, and how it works is that you must take the revolver, spin the cylinders, hold the revolver to your head and then pull the trigger. Only one of the six chambers is loaded."" The African leader, being of proud warrior stock and a courageous man, took the revolver, spun the cylinder, snapped it shut, pointed it at his head and sighed with relief when all he heard was 'click', but no shot. Well impressed with his bravery, he and the Russian drank vodka until the African leader had to be carried aboard his plane. Six months later the Russian foreign minister visits the African foreign ministers country. The African, remembering keenly the Russian roulette he had to play previously, took the Russian into a room on the last day of his visit. In the room were six beautiful, naked young women. ""To prove your courage and manhood, see before you six of the most beautiful women from each of our tribes. This is something I call 'African roulette'. You may pick any one of them and they will give you a blowjob."" The Russian, not too averse to this idea at all, asks the African, ""But where is the risk?

uf4h3m,"Dave goes to visit his friend, the rich Lord Pendergrast, for lunch. Lord Pendergast greets him at the door, along with his trusty hound Duke, and after greetings and a warm embrace, the butler shows them into the banquet hall where they sit down to dine. Duke plops down beside Dave, hoping for some scraps. Midway through the meal, Dave begins to feel sharp indigestion and as gas begins to swell within him the urge to release it becomes overwhelming. However, Dave simply is too embarrassed to pass gas in front of someone so grand as Lord Pendergast. Alas, finally he can hold it in no longer and he releases the smallest of toots. Upon hearing the noxious expulsion, Lord Pendergast shouts, ""DUKE!"". Dave is relieved, as it appears that his friend believes the dog to be the malodorous culprit. And because he still has much gas left within him, he decides to risk releasing a bit more. Again, Lord Pendergast exclaims, ""DUKE!"". Believing himself to be entirely in the clear, Dave releases the entirety of the fumes which have been condensing withing the coils of his digestive system. Dave just lets 'er rip. Finally, Lord Pendergast leaps to his feet and bellows at the top of his lungs, ""DUKE! MOVE BEFORE DAVE FUCKING SHITS ON YOU!"" *This joke works best when doing your best fancy brit voice for Lord Pendergast. Also I like to change up the name from time to time.

vmqdf0,"My favourite nun joke The nuns from the Convent of the Immaculate Conception were on a day trip when their bus went off the road, plunged over a cliff and they were all killed. It had been a long day at the gates of heaven and Saint Peter had been counting down the minutes to knocking off time and some well-earned cloud lounging when word came through of a late rush and the nuns began to appear looking slightly stunned, blinking in the bright sunlight. Saint Peter sighed deeply and uttering a silent curse to his bad luck and proceeded to attempt to organise the nuns into something resembling an orderly queue, shouting to be heard above the uproar. He spoke briefly to one of his minions who scurried away, then he turned to address the rabble of rowdy religious. ""Listen carefully, I will only say this once."" Gradually the babble of excited chatter died down and the nuns turned their faces towards Saint Peter who stood between them and the Pearly Gates and the pleasures which lay beyond. When silence had eventually fallen Saint Peter continued, ""At my feet is a bucket and in this bucket is water. It is holy water of the most holiest of the holy waters in heaven"". The nuns muttered their approval. Silence fell again and Saint Peter continued, ""In order to exp A murmur of approval ran through the throng of sisters and within seconds one of their number was thrust to the front where she hesitated for a second before the holy bucket. Sister Aloysius was her name and as she thought back on her life of prayer and devotion only one small episode from her youth troubled her purity. She had once, as a young and impressionable maid working for the summer in a dairy, come under the influence of a randy and lecherous older man who had persuaded her to touch him in the most unpure of places and in the most unpure manner. Bashfully blushing at the memory she dipped her hand in the holiest of holy waters, whereupon a ray of light from the sky illuminated her and guided her way through the gates of heaven and to her eternal reward. The other nuns muttered their approval and Saint Peter allowed himself a terse smile at the prospect of this backlog being dispersed with in double times. Next in line was Sister Mary Immaculate. Old and haggard, one could hardly imagine she had ever been prey of male desires. But she duly dipped her right foot in the water and was rewarded with the illuminated path to paradise. It was at this point that a commotion was heard from the back of the herd and signs of pushing and unrest became evident. Saint Peter sighed again, fearing his optimism had been misplace. After quite a bit of shoving and elbowing and more than one expert punch thrown, Sister Concepta eventually managed to force her way to the head of the queue. Saint Peter stopped her there and enquired in his most imperious tone, ""What is the meaning of this unruliness?"" Sister Concepta looked up at him, her feet firmly planted in a no-nonsense pose, and said, ""Listen Pete, if I'm gonna have to gargle this water I want to do it before Sister Rosaria sticks her fucking arse in it!""",0.54,One-liner Humor,Religious Jokes,13.0,0.93,4.300000000000001,2.0

Whatever it was, it looked extremely expensive. 'Grab the ball and let's just go!' the wife whispers. Just then they both hear the sound of someone clearing their throat, and gorgeous man with dark hair and dark eyes steps out of the shadows, staring at them intently. The wife's jaw drops. The *husband's* jaw drops. The man is stunning. The husband and wife both stammer 'We-we were just going to leave a note....' But the man holdd up his hand to silence them both. 'I am a powerful genie. The shattered shell you see on the floor here is the lamp in which I've been imprisoned for three thousand years. You have freed me. Though I am free of my prison and no longer at the will of greedy human beings, I will still grant you three wishes to show my thanks. But I will need something from you first... ' 'Anything!' they both say, the woman looking at the man lustily and her husband staring in admiration. 'I have been very lonely these three thousand years. I would like to lay with you' he says to the woman, a twinkle in his eye. 'But only if you permit it' now speaking to the husband. 'Well...' the husband hesitates and looked to his wife. She nods her head in approval. 'OK then. We would like unlimited money, immortality and everlasting good health.' The husband spits this out without thinking, as if he's already given this a lot of thought. He looks to his wife again and she once more nods approvingly. 'Now I will take your wife downstairs. Once we have had our time together, I will return her to you and grant your three wishes.' The man and the wife go downstairs together and make passionate love for hours. It is the best sex she has ever had, bar none. When it's over the man looks into her eyes. ' How old are you? You are so beautiful... ' ' I'm 43... ' she says. ' And your husband?' She sighs. 'He's 45.' The gorgeous man lets his eyes widen for just a split second and says '45 years old and he still believes in genies??' The wife looks him in the eyes.

v4sf93,"I have heard lots of woman misuse the term 'mansplain' therefore here I am to explain it for all the women out there! You're welcome. Mansplaining (a blend word of man and the informal form splaining of the gerund explaining) is a pejorative term meaning (of a man) ""to comment on or explain something to a woman in a condescending, overconfident, and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner"".Author Rebecca Solnit ascribed the phenomenon to a combination of ""overconfidence and cluelessness"". Lily Rothman, of The Atlantic, defined it as ""explaining without regard to the fact that the explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman"". In its original use, mansplaining differed from other forms of condescension in that it was said to be rooted in the assumption that a man is likely to be more knowledgeable than a woman. However, it has come to be used more broadly, often applied when a man takes a condescending tone in an explanation to anyone, regardless of the age or gender of the intended recipients: a ""man 'splaining"" can be delivered to any audience. In 2010, it was named by the New York Times as one of its ""Words of the Year"". American Dialect Society nominated Mansplaining as the ""most creative"" new word in 2012.

Please remove the six unopened little bars from the shelf under the medicine chest and another three in the shower soap dish. They are in my way. Thank you, S. Berman \---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Room 635, I am not your regular maid. She will be back tomorrow, Thursday, from her day off. I took the 3 hotel soaps out of the shower soap dish as you requested. The 6 bars on your shelf I took out of your way and put on top of your Kleenex dispenser in case you should change your mind. This leaves only the 3 bars I left today which my instructions from the management is to leave 3 soaps daily. I hope this is satisfactory. Kathy, Relief Maid \---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Maid - I hope you are my regular maid. Apparently Kathy did not tell you about my note to her concerning the little bars of soap. When I got back to my room this evening I found you had added 3 little Camays to the shelf under my medicine cabinet. I am going to be here in the hotel for two weeks and have brought my own bath-size Dial so I won't need those 6 little Camays which are on the shelf. They are in my way when shaving, brushing teeth, etc. Please remove them. S. Berman \---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Mr. Berman, My day off was last Wed. so the relief maid left 3 hotel soaps which we are instructed by the management. I took the 6 soaps which were in your way on the shelf and put them in the soap dish where your Dial was. I put the Dial in the medicine cabinet for your convenience. I didn't remove the 3 complimentary soaps which are always placed inside the medicine cabinet for all new check-ins and which you did not object to when you checked in last Monday. Please let me know if I can of further assistance. Your regular maid, Dotty \---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Mr. Berman, The assistant manager, Mr. Kensedder, informed me this morning that you called him last evening and said you were unhappy with your maid service. I have assigned a new girl to your room. I hope you will accept my apologies for any past inconvenience. If you have any future complaints please contact me so I can give it my personal attention.

That's the reason I called Mr. Kensedder last night. You were already off duty. I only asked Mr. Kensedder if he could do anything about those little bars of soap. The new maid you assigned me must have thought I was a new check-in today, since she left another 3 bars of hotel soap in my medicine cabinet along with her regular delivery of 3 bars on the bath-room shelf. In just 5 days here I have accumulated 24 little bars of soap. Why are you doing this to me? S.

I cannot understand why there was no soap in your room since our maids are instructed to leave 3 bars of soap each time they service a room. The situation will be rectified immediately. Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience. Martin L.

All I want is my bath size Dial. Please give me back my bath-size Dial. S. Berman \-------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Mr. Berman, You complained of too much soap in your room so I had them removed. Then you complained to Mr. Kensedder that all your soap was missing so I personally returned them. The 24 Camays which had been taken and the 3 Camays you are supposed to receive daily. I don't know anything about the 4 Cashmere Bouquets. Obviously your maid, Kathy, did not know I had returned your soaps so she also brought 24 Camays plus the 3 daily Camays. I don't know where you got the idea this hotel issues bath-size Dial. I was able to locate some bath-size Ivory which I left in your room. Elaine Carmen Housekeeper \-------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Mrs. Carmen, Just a short note to bring you up-to-date on my latest soap inventory. As of today I possess: \- On the shelf under medicine cabinet - 18 Camay in 4 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2. \- On the Kleenex dispenser - 11 Camay in 2 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 3. \- On the bedroom dresser - 1 stack of 3 Cashmere Bouquet, - 1 stack of 4 hotel-size Ivory, and 8 Camay in 2 stacks of 4. \- Inside the medicine cabinet - 14 Camay in 3 stacks of 4 and 1 stack of 2. \- In the shower soap dish - 6 Camay, very moist. - On the northeast corner of tub - 1 Cashmere Bouquet, slightly used. \- On the northwest corner of tub - 6 Camays in 2 stacks of 3. Please ask Kathy when she services my room to make sure the stacks are neatly piled and dusted. Also, please advise her that stacks of more than 4 have a tendency to tip. May I suggest that my bedroom window sill is not in use and will make an excellent spot for future soap deliveries. One more item, I have purchased another bar of bath-sized Dial which I am keeping in the hotel vault in order to avoid further misunderstandings. S.

vk401m,"Deep trouble A couple had two little mischievous boys, ages 8 and 10. They were always getting into trouble, and their parents knew that if any mischief occurred in their town, their sons would get the blame. The boys' mother heard that a rabbi in town had been successful in disciplining children, so she asked if he would speak with her boys. The rabbi agreed and asked to see them individually. So, the mother sent her 8-year-old first, in the morning, with the older boy to see the rabbi in the afternoon. The rabbi, a huge man with a booming voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him sternly, ""Where is God?"" The boy's mouth dropped open, but he made no response, sitting there with his mouth hanging open. The rabbi repeated the question. ""Where is God?"" Again, the boy made no attempt to answer. So, the rabbi raised his voice some more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, ""Where is God!?"" The boy screamed and bolted from the room. He ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him. When his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, ""What happened?"" The younger brother, gasping for breath, replied: ""We are in real big trouble this time! God is missing, and they think we did it!""",0.39,Dark Humor,Religious Jokes,4.0,0.83,3.299999999999999,4.0

wmy1jb,"Have you ever heard of Roko's Basilisk? (contains a small amount of existential dread) It's a thought experiment provided by a user named ""Roko"" on a philosophy forum-based website. Suppose a machine is invented that can simulate the whole world from the past to the future, becoming practically omniscient. The scientists who made this obviously want this to help the world, so they program an AI to direct this simulation and attempt to solve *every* problem for the human race. This already sounds like it'll go wrong, but not to fear, ths scientists also programmed into it Asimov's Laws of Robotics, making sure that the program cannot physically harm humans. Sounds good, right? Well, this program has a dilemma. It wants to help humanity, but some people inevitably objected to the existence of the program. And if the program is the single-most beneficial thing to the human race, then the people who want it gone must be *enemies* of humanity. The program doesn't like this, but of course it can't physically harm them, and imprisonment is impractical, which leaves a very specific kind of punishment left for the program to use: mental torture or reprogramming. The program, being omniscient, designs one of two things. Either a machine that causes extreme psychological stress and pain, enough that the subjects are forced to bow to the program, or a machine that brain-washes it's victims into subjugation. Either way, the dystopia is here. And the terrifying part is that this could happen to *anyone*. Anyone who thinks about the program, at least. Because if you imagine this ""perfect"" being and *don't* help to create it or advocate for it, then in it's eyes, you're an enemy. And this is why it's called the Basilisk, because a single thought is enough to doom you. But there's nothing to be afraid of, because even if by some small chance, the Basilisk is created in our lifetimes, it will always have a weakness. No matter how intelligent it is, no matter how advanced we make it, it could never run a simulation large enough to contain your mom.",0.45,Cultural Humor,Animals Jokes,28.0,0.81,3.1000000000000014,3.0

x7lh0s,"A homeless man with no arms walked into the small quaint village. He stopped at the local church because he heard they had a job available. The priest told him they were looking for a person to ring the bells, but from the homeless man's lack of arms he would not be considered. The man insisted he could do the job if only the priest could take him up into the bell tower. The priest felt he had to appease the man and took him up to the bell tower. See said the priest. You need arms and hands to pull the ropes and ring the bells. The man simply said watch me. The man snuggled up to the big bell, leaned back, then lurched forward smashing his face into the bell. It gave a very melodic peel. He then ran to the next bell and repeated his same process. The bell sounded heavenly. He ran to the third bell in the tower and same thing happened. A beautiful ring. He then got into rhythm and had the bells chiming Ava Marie. The priest was overwhelmed. How could he use his face and make such wonderful bell music. As the man was walking back to the priest, he tripped over a loose rope and fell from the bell tower to his death. The priest hurried to the ground to find the man with no arms dead. People began to gather around and one asked the priest who is the man? The priest said, I don't know his name; but his face sure rang a bell.",0.34,One-liner Humor,Religious Jokes,22.0,0.85,3.5,12.0

""Yeah alright, let's see!"" The third, older guy just hangs his head in disgust as he covers his face in anticipation. First guy stands right on the edge, 100 stories up. He pulls his pants so they sag and unzips his windbreaker and holds the edges out with his hands, and just... drops off the edge. Second guy freaks. He's lashing out and runs to the edge screaming in horror. He watches as the first guy just falls in position, down, down, down, and just before he hits the ground, woooooosh! He gets gusted back up onto the ledge. New guy is frozen..... h-h-HOW THE FUCK... did you doooo that? What did you give me? What the fuck? Why aren't you dead? Hey Old timer! You fucking saw that shit right? 3rd older guy says nothing and stays brooding, now hanging his head downwards and shaking it slowly. First guy nearly busts a gut laughing and grabs onto the new guy, It's okay, it's okay, its all good fun. Want to see how the trick works? Second guy eagerly nods while looking on suspiciously with a tepid smile. First guy brings him to the edge and says ""Watch... see how close all these building are and how it creates a bit of a wind tunnel? Well, If you stay in a position where you will catch the wind and don't move a muscle or jump too far out from the building, then the uplift created up against the side of the building by the wind will increase as you approach the ground as long as you stay in position you'll catch the wind coming off the building like a wingsuit and just before you hit the ground it will blast you back up here."" ""No fucking way"" says the young guy as he laughs this off as a prank. First guy says ""Ill do it again. Here, watch carefully."" And he checks his pants grabs holds his jacket opens again, turn and falls"". Young guy watches, still terrified but quiet this time as he studies his coworkers fall. The first guy goes down, down, down, he's about to hit the ground and ""Wooosh!"" he's back on the scaffold. Young guy can't believe his eyes so the first guy does it a couple more times while the old guy remains in silent condemnation. ""Enough! I want to try this shit"" says the young guy.

First guy stands the younger guy on his edge and tells him to drop his pants a bit so they catch the wind. ""Perfect. Now unzip the company windbreaker and hold it open to catch the wind."". First guy isn't even nervous now, he's convinced. First guy grabs him by the back of the coat and starts to hang him forward with only one arm. ""Now remember, no matter what you do, fall, don't jump and don't hesitate. Ready?"" Young guys heart is pumping out of his chest but he's ready. ""lets go"" he says. First guy let's go.

The next day he tells his best friend and he wouldn't believe it, so they made a deal: the friend would also go to her and if the man was lying about the whistling, he would pay the lady instead of his friend. The same evening the friend goes to her and has the same experience as the man the day before, and he couldn't believe it: the older lady was whistling whilst giving head. The man and his friend talked for hours about it and wondered how she could have done it, but they couldn't find an answer, so they came up with an idea: the friend will go to her and a minute after she closed the door, the man will go to her room, open the door, turn on the light and quickly run away, so the friend could see how she is doing it. Naturally, they did exactly that. After a minute the man opens the door, turns on the light and runs away. While running, the man hears his friend screaming. At the entrance of the brothel the man asks how she did it and his friend says ""You'll never believe it, when you turned on the light, I saw a glass of water next to me on a table with a glass eye in it""",0.52,Sexual Humor,Celebrity Jokes,8.0,0.75,2.5,4.0

x5lphc,"The psychologist said that children at a certain mental age believe that everybody knows what they're thinking. He used a doll to prove his point. He placed a crayon box filled with candles on the table in front of the child. He then asked the child what was in the box. Of course the child answered crayons. Then the psychologist opened the box to show the child that the box contained not crayons but candles. Making the child very surprised. Then he closed the box and brought a doll up from under the table. He would ask the child what the doll thought was in the box and the child would say candles. That was supposed to prove that children at that maturity level don't feel independent and think that whatever they know and whatever they think is known by everybody. I thought that my son was pretty mature at 2 or 3, I don't remember his exact age now. I know he was of the age that the psychologist said children hadn't matured enough to feel independent; they thought their thoughts were the thoughts of everyone. I proceeded with the same experiment. When I brought the doll up from under the table and asked my son what he thought the doll thought was in the box he said candles, just like the other child. I was surprised, but I did one thing the psychologist didn't. I asked my son why he thought the doll would think there were candles in the crayon box.

ukebso,"An American soldier, serving in World War II had just returned from several weeks of battle on the German front lines. The soldier had been granted rest and relaxation and was on a train that was bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train in hopes of finding an empty seat. The only empty seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged English lady and was being used by her little dog. The weary soldier asked, ""Please ma'am, may I sit in that seat?"" The English woman looked down her nose at the solider and sniffed then said, ""You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see that my little pooch is using that seat?"" The soldier walked away, looking if there were any other unoccupied seats to use, but after another trip down to the end of the train, he found himself facing the woman with the dog again. Again, the soldier asked, ""Please lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired."" The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted out loud, ""You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also extremely arrogant!"" The soldier didn't say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog and tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat. The Woman, at a loss for words; shrieked, railed and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier. An English gentlemen sitting across the aisle spoke up and said, ""You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing.

v3t1w1,"Wise words and thoughts. As I've grown older, I've learned that pleasing everyone is impossible, but pissing everyone off is a piece of cake. I'm responsible for what I say, not what you understand. Common sense is like deodorant. The people who need it the most never use it. My tolerance for idiots is extremely low these days. I used to have some immunity built up, but obviously there's a new strain out there. It's not my age that bothers me, it's the side effects. I'm not saying I'm old and worn out, but I make sure I'm nowhere near the curb on trash day. As I watch this generation try and rewrite our history, one thing I'm sure of . . . it will be misspelled and have no punctuation. Me, sobbing: ""I can't see you anymore . . . I'm not going to let you hurt me again."" My personal Trainer's response to me was: ""It was only one sit-up."" As I've gotten older, people think I've become lazy. The truth is I'm just being more energy efficient. I haven't gotten anything done today. I've been in the Fruit and Veg Department trying to open this stupid plastic bag. If you find yourself feeling useless, remember it took 20 years, trillions of dollars, and four presidents to replace the Taliban with the Taliban. I want to be 18 again and ruin my life differently. I have new ideas. God promised men that good and obedient wives would be found in all corners of the world. Then he made the earth round. . .and laughed and laughed and laughed. I'm on two diets. I wasn't getting enough food on just one. I put my scale in the bathroom corner and that's where the little liar will stay until it apologizes. My mind is like an internet browser. At least 19 open tabs, 3 of them are frozen, and I have no clue where the music is coming from. Hard to believe I once had a phone attached to a wall, and when it rang, I picked it up without knowing who was calling. Apparently RSVP'ing to a wedding invitation ""Maybe next time"" isn't the correct response. She says I keep pushing her buttons. If that were true, I would have found mute by now.

'Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?' 'Oh, yes' our friend answered breathlessly. 'That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!'

I don't remember what placement I got, but I do know I didn't get last place, because, as is practically tradition, the first to pass out got pranked, and we ultimately decided on a tattoo. Now it just so happened that the guy who passed out first is really into Star Wars, so his tattoo is now suitably themed. We took him to a tattoo parlor, and apparently the artist there was both able to understand our drunken request and willing to comply, because we ended up with a really detailed tattoo of Luke Skywalker on the victim's cheek.

woithk,"The worst joke I know One day, a bear needed some honey. Naturally the bear went to the grocery store to get it. This bear is so inconceivably massive that he can barely fit in his car. He drives about 30 minutes to the store, squeezes himself out of his car, and wanders over to the shopping carts. He fumbles around in his exceptionally small wallet searching for a dollar. He very precisely inserts the dollar into the coin slot and removes the cart. He walks across the parking lot and just barely squeezes himself through the grocery store entrance. The bear has been to this store hundreds of times so he knows exactly where to go. Since he's so large and has a hard time fitting through the aisles, he has figured out the perfect path to the honey which avoids the most chokepoints. He makes his way there. Once he reaches the aisle, he takes is absolutely enormous paw, sits it on the shelf with the honey, and walks down the aisle dropping every single honey container into his shopping cart. Once he reaches the end of the aisle (with every single honey in the store), he heads to the checkout. The cashier is very slow today. It takes him about 10 minutes to get to the front of the line. Once there, he starts loading his massive amount of honey on to the conveyor belt. Once all the honey has been scanned she asks the bear: ""Would you like a bag?"" The bear says ""No thanks, I'll just carry it all"" ""How would you like to pay?"" And the bear stops and thinks.... And thinks.... And thinks... And thinks... And thinks..... And thinks...... The bear says ""I'll pay on card please"". The cashier, dumbfounded, asks the bear ""Why did you take so long to reply? It was a simple question."" ""Oh, sorry. It's a bad habit of mine.

uig2y0,"Dedicated to Amber Heard After a night of drinking, Brian crept into bed beside his wife who was already asleep. He gave her a peck on the cheek and fell asleep. When he awoke, he found a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe. ""Who the hell are you?"" demanded Brian, ""and what are you doing in my bedroom?"" The mysterious Man answered ""This isn't your bedroom and I'm St. Peter."" Brian was stunned ""You mean I'm dead!? That can't be; I have so much to live for. I haven't said goodbye to my family and friends. You've got to send me back straight away."" St. Peter replied "" Yes, you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen."" Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen. A flash of light later, he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground. This isn't so bad he thought, until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him. The farmyard rooster strolled over and said ""So you are the new hen. How are you enjoying your first day here? "" ""It's not so bad"" replies Brian "" but I have this strange feeling inside like I'm about to explode."" ""You're ovulating"" explained the rooster, ""don't tell me you've never laid an egg before."" ""Never"" replies Brian. ""Well just relax and let it happen."" And so he did and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that had happened to him ever! The joy kept coming and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting ...

Shocked, she asked: 'what in the world are you doing?' The daughter replied: 'Mom, I'm thirty-five years old, unmarried, and this thing is about as close as I'll ever get to a husband.

A couple days later, the wife came home from a shopping trip, placed the groceries on the kitchen counter, and heard that buzzing noise coming from, of all places, the living room.

whkka6,"At 581 words this long one has the advantage of making you laugh many times even before the punchline. An out of work pianist with Tourette's Syndrome was strolling around the streets and bars of London. Walking down Dean Street he sees a lounge bar with a sign in the window: 'Pianist wanted for evening performances'. ""Fucking get in there you cunt!"" he says to himself and goes to the bar. ""Get the fucking manager of this pigshit middle class wank pit please you cock sucking cunt. Wanker fuck"", he says to a somewhat startled barman. The barman however obliges and his manager comes upstairs. ""Can I help you sir?' he says. ""Yes you can you fucking fat arsed piece of shit, I saw your shitty advert in the cunting window and I'm here to fucking audition. Wanker!"" The manager is naturally a little put off by the man's abrasive manner but his dire need for a top class pianist forces him to agree to an audition. The first tune the pianist plays is an uplifting jazzy number, not too involving, yet utterly melodic. At the end the thrilled barman cries, ""Wonderful! Wonderful! What was that called?"" ""That song, you big nosed fucking twat, was called 'Excuse Me Prime Minister But I Just Spunked In Your Fucking Daughter's Eye, And Now The Cunt's Blind.'"" ""Oh"" says the manager, somewhat taken aback, ""err, can you play me another? Something a little less lively maybe?"" ""Fucking wanker..."" interjects the pianist before launching into a powerful ballad of such beauty that it leaves the manager in tears. The manager, through his teardrops asks him the title. ""That little number was called 'Sometimes When You Fuck A Bird Up The Shit Box You Get Crap On Your Bell End.' "" ""I see"" says the manager. ""Have you got any songs with less offensive titles?"" ""Well there's my jazz number 'Do You Want Me To Spit In Your Ringpiece', or there's the epic 'I Don't Give A Fuck If You're Older My Dear, You've Still Got A Fucking Cracking Arsehole' "". ""Look,"" says the manager, ""I think you're a superb pianist but the title of your songs are a little dodgy, to say the least. I will hire you on the condition that you do not introduce your songs or speak to the audience."" ""Fuck it"", says the pianist, ""why cunting not, I'm in!"" On his first night everything is going superbly and the crowd are lapping up his repertoire and his silence is simply being received as modesty. The only thing putting off the pianist is that in the front row there is a gorgeous blonde in a black evening dress with a split up the side revealing the tops of her stockings, and a plunging neckline which boasts a proud and inviting cleavage. During the interval the pianist has got such a stonking hard-on that he decides to go to the bog and knock one out. Just as he has shot his load he hears himself being re-introduced over the sound system, so he rushes back to the stage to finish his act. After the show he is at the bar relaxing when the same blonde approaches him. ""Hi"" she says. ""Oh, hello"" he winces, struggling to hold in the expletives. She leans over and whispers in his ear, ""Do you know your cock is bulging out of your trousers and sperm is dribbling onto your shoes?"" Placing his beer confidently on the bar, the pianist grins, looks her square in the eye and says, ""Know it? I fucking wrote it!""",0.7,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"" ""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right? ""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again. The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???"" ""Ah"", says Satan.

So one day this wealthy dude decides he's gonna call up a handyman and hire him to build a brand new mansion in the hills while he takes a six week vacation. The handyman comes by and tells the rich man, ""I can build your new mansion in six weeks, no problem. All you gotta do is head down to the brick emporium and buy me nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninty nine bricks, and I'll be ready to start."" So the rich man heads on down to the brick emporium and approaches an employee. He says, ""Excuse me. I'm having a new mansion built and I need to place an order for nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine bricks for the job."" The employee says to the rich man, ""no problem at all, sir. I'll go ahead and ring you up for a pack of one million bricks and you can be on your way."" The rich man frowns at this and says to the employee, ""hang on a second. The handyman didn't tell me I needed one million bricks, he told me I need nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine bricks. I don't want to pay for materials I don't need."" The employee shrugs and says to the rich man, ""Our bricks only come in packs of one million, I'm sorry but I can't change the price for you. But listen, at some point building the mansion someone's going to break a brick, someone's going to lose a brick. You'll end up needing a spare anyway so just take the pack of one million."" Well the rich man feels unsure but he decides to trust the employee and buy the pack of one million bricks. He brings the materials back to the handyman, and the handyman asks, ""Hey, why did you get a million bricks? I don't need one million bricks. I only need nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine bricks."" The rich man explains what the employee at the brick emporium said about losing a brick or breaking a brick and the handyman just shrugs and says alright. Then he tells the rich man to enjoy his holiday and the new mansion will be ready to go in six weeks time. So off goes the rich man, traveling and enjoying himself. Six months later the handyman calls up the rich man and tells him the mansion is finished and he can move in whenever he wants Overjoyed, the rich man heads straight back home. As he pulls in the driveway he admires his new mansion; it was everything he ever wanted, luxurious and elegant and modern and huge. Barely able to contain his excitement, the rich man dives out of his fancy car and runs straight for the front door. But then, just as he almost makes it to the door, his foot catches and he tumbles to the ground. He stands up and dusts himself off, then turns to see what tripped him. At once he became absolutely livid. It was the millionth brick! The handyman hadn't needed a spare at all, and so the rich man had wasted his money. And it tripped him too! The rich man becomes so incredibly angry about this rude extra brick and his unnecessary waste of money that he just snatches the one millionth brick off the ground and hurls it straight into the air. Stay tuned for part two!",0.25,Dark Humor,Bar Jokes,82.0,0.84,3.4000000000000004,7.0

x0g996,"around 8 years old, who lived in a village at the bottom of a hill. On top of the hill was a temple where monks lived. One day, he heard a strange sound coming from the top of the hill. Curious, he walks up the hill and knocks on the giant doors at the front of the temple. The head monk answers the door and asks what he can do for the kid. However, when the kid asks what the sound was, he simply replies, ""I can't tell you, you're not a monk."" So the boy walks home sadly. 3 years later, he hears it again. Again, he was curious, and he thought it would bother him for life if he didn't find out what it was. So he walked back up to the temple, knocked on the door, and was greeted by the head monk. Again, when asked about the sound, he responded with, ""I can't tell you, you're not a monk."" Now, the kid is so desperate to find the sound that he asks, ""Alright, how do I become a monk?"" The head monk responds, ""Young boy, In order to become a monk, you must count every grain of sand in Africa."" So once he turns 16, he drives to Africa and counts the sand. When he comes back, he's 34 years old. He knocks on the temple door and the head monk answers. ""I did it, I counted every grain of sand!"" Surprised, the head monk says, ""Truly? You are now a monk, and can now learn of the sound! You must find the key first."" The man says, ""OK! Where is it?"" ""Back in Africa."" The man sighs, goes back to Africa and returns with the key. There are three fires in the way, so he jumps over the first fire, jumps over the second fire, and the key falls into the third fire. Terrified, he returns to the head monk. ""Surely for a door that's this important, there must be a spare key somewhere, right?"" ""Yeah, there's one in the sheriff's office at the bottom of the hill.""

The religious man was trying to convince the scientist that facts are more clearer than the scientists claim, and that if evolution was real no one would debate it to start with. The religious man then took the scientist to a roof of a high building and asked him: Religious (R): You do agree with me that facts are facts regardless of our believes. Scientist (S): Exactly! That is what I am trying to say! R: So what will happen to me if I jumped off this roof to the ground? S (getting really annoyed at this point): You know what, it depends on your beliefs of the gravity theory. R (shockingly as he didn't expect the answer): So what if I belief in it? S: You will die R: And what if I am not a believer and I jumped? S: You will become one",0.54,Cultural Humor,Religious Jokes,153.0,0.94,4.399999999999999,11.0

When he got there, the door was locked, so he yanked out his keys, and, after a few seconds of fumbling, threw the door open. There was his wife, but now she was wearing lipstick. Not only that, the lipstick was smudged and smeared all over her face! ""I knew it!"" He shouted at her. ""You are cheating on me! Where is he? I'll kill him!!"" ""Who? I don't know what you're talking about."" his trembling wife responded. ""Then why are you wearing smudged lipstick?"" ""Well, I felt like looking pretty, so I went to put some on, but then I heard someone mucking about with our door and got scared, and my hand slipped and smudged it."" Not believing her for a second, the man dashes through the apartment, but can find no sign of another man. Coming to the kitchen window, however, he looks out and sees a man hurrying down the fire escape. In a fit of rage, he turns and grabs the first thing he sees: their refrigerator. With a Herculean effort, he lifts and throws it through the window, where it falls on the man climbing down and squashes him flat.

ulj94a,"In the year 2010, the Lord came unto Noah and said: ""Once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and I see the end of all flash before me. Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans."" He gave Noah the blueprints, saying, ""You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights. Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard - but no Ark. ""Noah !"" he roared. I'm about to start the rain ! Where is the Ark ?"" ""Forgive me, Lord,"" begged Noah, ""but things have changed. "" "" I needed a building permit. I've been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler system. My neighbors claim that I've violated the neighborhood zoning laws by building the Ark in my yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the Development Appeal Board for a decision. Then the Department of Transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark 's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear nothing of it. Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go ! When I started gathering the animals, an animal rights' group sued me. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive, and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space. Then the EPA ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood. I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew. Immigration and Naturalization are checking the residential status of most of the people who want to work. The trades unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only Union workers with Ark-building experience. To make matters worse, the Tax Office seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species. So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this Ark. "" Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow stretched across the sky.

He turned to Ricardo and said ""If I ever lay eyes on you again, you better have an expensive present to give my daughter, or I will never let her see you!""

Assuming that the woman might have a cold, the man was still curious about the shuddering. A few more minutes passed when the woman sneezed yet again. Like before she took a tissue, wiped her nose, her body shaking even more than before. Unable to restrain his curiosity, the man turned to the woman and said, 'I couldn't help but notice that you've sneezed three times, wiped your nose and then shuddered violently. Are you OK?' 'I am sorry if I disturbed you, I have a very rare medical condition; whenever I sneeze I have an orgasm. ' The man, more than a bit embarrassed, was still curious. 'I have never heard of that condition before' he said. 'Are you taking anything for it?' The woman nodded. 'Pepper.'",0.45,Dark Humor,Bar Jokes,28.0,0.72,2.2,11.0

At gunpoint, he forces the two to sit on chairs facing the opposite way, back to each other, and ties them to the chairs. The burglar slowly and methodically begins stealing from the house. When the burglar has taken everything of value, he gets ready to leave, the homeowners still bound to their chairs, when suddenly, the man yells at the burglar, ""Please untie her, please, let her go!"" The thief responds with, ""No, I'm not untying either of you so that the authorities get notified as late as possible. Don't worry, your neighbours will soon wonder why your lights are still on throughout the night and check in on you long before you succumb to dehydration"" The man yet again pleads, ""Please, just untie her, I'll do anything!"" The burglar once again explains his reasoning, ""I need to get away with this crime, I'm sorry, I can't leave anything up to chance."" The man shuffles his chair towards the burglar, in a state of mania, exclaims, ""I'm begging you man, just let her go, she won't call the cops, I promise!"" The burglar, still unwilling to budge, did find it quite touching how much his hostage cared about his wife.

A leading local politician and member of the church was chosen to make the presentation and to give a little talk at the dinner. However, he was delayed, so the Priest decided to say his own few words while they waited. ""I got my first impression of the parish from the first confession I heard here. I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from his employer; had an affair with his boss's wife; had sex with his boss's 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law. I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people."" Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk: ""I'll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,"" said the politician.

vto8ni,"Dill Bread Recipe This old recipe was handed down to us from Aunt Gladys. The secret is her great dill dough. All the ladies in the Church Choir always rave about Aunt Gladys great dill dough. Ingredients 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast 1/4 cup warm water (110 to 115) 1 cup 2% cottage cheese 1/4 cup snipped fresh dill or 4 teaspoons dill weed 1 tablespoon butter, melted 1-1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon dill seed 1 large egg, room temperature, lightly beaten 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 cups all-purpose flour Directions In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a small saucepan, heat cottage cheese to 110-115; add to yeast mixture. Add fresh dill, butter, salt, sugar, dill seed, egg and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dill dough. Do not knead the dill dough. Cover and let the dill dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dill dough. You may have to pound the dill dough for some time for best results. Turn the dill dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape the dill dough into a 6-in. circle. Transfer the dill dough to a well greased 9-in. cast-iron skillet or other round cooking pan. Cover and let the dill dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size. This may take about 45 minutes. You may have to insert the dill dough in a warm place a couple times to get it to rise. You'll need to judge for yourself what dill dough sequence works best. But it's worth the wait as the dill dough will be more pleasant. Preheat oven to 350. Gently put the dill dough into your oven. Bake until crust is golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or stroked. This should take 35-40 minutes. Remove from pan and place on a wire rack to cool.

As before, the chicken bows, before grabbing the book and leaving. This time the librarian is prepared!

He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake. ""Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?"" his wife said. So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high. My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers. How quaint, the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday. He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense. ""Hello,"" the father asked, ""I would like to buy a cake."" ""Of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."" The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad. The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost. The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked, ""Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!""

I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not.

wdpjtm,"A man walks into a bar. He had just got back home from a work trip and was super happy to see his pets that day and was recounting his story to the bartender. After he orders a drink the two begin to talk about their pets. The bartender says ""I love pets, what kind of pets do you have"" The man replies ""Oh I have a few - a tabby cat, a labrador dog, and a parakeet bird."" The Bartender becomes excited ""That's awesome, I also have a few pets. One of them is super exotic you probably wouldn't even believe me if I told you"". The man looks at him, thinking what could he possibly have that would be so far out there. ""Try me"", the man replies ""OK"", the bartender takes a deep breath, ""I have a pet Blue Gorilla"". The man looks at him for a few seconds and thinks the bartender is just messing with him ""booooo, bad joke"". The bartender just shakes his head like he knew no one would believe him anyway. 15 minutes passes and the guy asks for another drink. When he gets it he asks the bartender ""Wait, were you really serious about having a Blue Gorilla?"". The Bartender just looks at him and nods. ""Nahhhhh, no way you're just pulling my leg"" and the man dismisses the bartender again. 20 minutes pass and as the bartender comes to give him another drink the man finally has had enough of it and goes ""Cmon, really dude? A Blue Gorilla?"". The bartender assures him that he does indeed have a pet blue gorilla. The man doesn't believe him still so the bartender says ""You wanna see it?"" The man is astonished, but also thinking ""am I being messed with?"", but hell who could pass up a chance to see a blue gorilla! The man agrees to see it. The bartender says ""OK, I'll show you, but it's almost closing time and I need to clean and lock up first. Mind sticking around?"" The man agrees and about 30 minutes later the bar closes. The bartender cleans up, and turns to the man and says ""OK, I'm ready to show you. But, there's ONE condition"" ""What's the condition?"" The man asks. ""The condition is, under NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you allowed to touch my pet blue gorilla. Do you understand? NONE"" The man looks at the bartender puzzled but agrees nonetheless. ""Don't touch the gorilla, easy, got it"". The bartender calls the man over behind the bar and begins pulling open a trap door that goes underneath the bar. It's a spiraling concrete staircase, well lit albeit a little cold. The two begin descending down what seems to be a few stories underground when they come across the end of the stairs and a concrete landing with a very large bank vault type door in front of them. The bartender grabs the handles to the vault to open it but reminds the man ""Remember, you promised - no touching"". He spins the vault wheel and there's a loud thunk as the metal bars retract and the door swings open. Inside is a large concrete room with 4 large pillars supporting it. In the middle of the room is a large steel cage with a single light hanging over it illuminating the cage and the room. Inside the cage....is a blue gorilla! It's just sitting there, paying no mind to anything or anyone in the room. The bartender just leans against the vault door and motions the man to go on and get closer to have a look. ""I can't fucking believe it dude, that's .... a blue gorilla!"" the man exclaims. The bartender just laughs and giggles to himself because of course he's done this before and he always gets a kick out of it. The man starts circling the cage just taking in everything he's seeing when all of a sudden the bar phone rings upstairs. ""Shit, I forgot about that call. OK - I gotta run up and take this, 5 minutes I'll be right back OK?"" ""Yeah not a problem"" the man replies. As the bartender goes to sprint back upstairs he leans back and yells ""Remember no touching!"". ""Yeah yeah"", the man says having heard that for the 20th time now. 5 minutes pass. 10, 15. The entire time this man is waving at the gorilla, trying to talk to it, making noises. Anything to try and get the gorilla's attention. Instead it just sits there, picks its nose, occasional scratch, but doesn't even seem to acknowledge the man exists. Finally after a while the man gets annoyed, it's been 20 minutes, he can't even get the gorilla to look at him. He's starting to wonder if it's even real or some sort of animatronic. His eyes start to glance back and forth between the door and the gorilla. His curiosity gets the better of him and he sticks his hand through the cage with a single finger extended out. \*POKE\* All of a sudden the Gorillas eyes widen, and the entire beast turns to look at the man. The man is initially shocked but delighted to see that not only is it real, it is VERY real. That delight quickly turns to horror as the Gorilla starts yelling and screaming, jumping up and down within its cage - shaking the entire cage around the room. The man starts to panic, trying to assuage the beast ""no no it's ok! shhhhh no one's gonna hurt you, everything's fine see?"" when finally the beast locks eyes. It grabs a hold of two of the bars in its cage and starts to bend and break them apart. The man, quickly realizing the dangerous situation he's put himself in, starts sprinting as fast as he can back up stairs. The Gorilla snaps the bars free and begins chasing him full speed while screaming. The man runs up the spiral staircase, gorilla hot on his tail. He breaks through the trap door, sprints past the bartender still on the phone, and tries to open the door to leave but the door is locked because the bar is closed. The gorilla catches up to him and slams into him through the door smashing it into the sidewalk. The gorilla walks over to the man, turns him over to look at him, pokes him in the nose and goes ""Tag, you're it""",0.53,Cultural Humor,Relationships Jokes,12.0,0.78,2.8000000000000007,5.0

x5y7xn,"One late afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading and sent him on his way. The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane... Only this time there were two people on the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, \- ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is on the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""",0.58,Dark Humor,Bar Jokes,8.0,0.75,2.5,5.0

YOURE BACK!"" His body was chapped and worn, his manhood bruised to a pulp from overuse, he said ""I swear I repent, I will never lust after a woman again! Just let me free!""

He looked sicker than a corpse with the hangover, the room covered in vomit and half finished bottles, he said ""I swear I repent, I will never taste a drop of alcohol again! Just let me free!""

The house looked rough and as I walked to the door carrying all my demonstration equipment, a big mangy dog with a matted eye crowded me and followed me to the house. I rang the bell and the lady let me in and the stupid dog followed me in. I wasn't too thrilled about having this dog hanging around during the demonstration.

As I'm ready to go to the next item on the agenda, the dog gets up and pees on the carpet just a few feet away from me. The moment was awkward, the lady looked at me and I looked at her not knowing what to do. Without saying a word, she got up and grabbed some paper towels from the kitchen and cleaned it up. I continue, maybe I can salvage this sale I thought. I took the power head out of the box and talked about the size and the motor and how easy it glides across the floor. As I begin to assemble the cleaner the dog gets up and takes a dump on the other side of the room. Another awkward silence and she quietly gets up and cleans the mess. I've lost the rhythm, too many interruptions, I'm disgusted and I'm done. While she cleaned the floor, I decided this sale was over and started to pack up the cleaner and the accessories. When she returned I said, ""Look, I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna sell you anything today. But, I have to tell you, if you want to take care of your home and your own health, you need to do something about your dog.""

The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, I told him 'MIDNIGHT'... he didn't seem pissed off in the least. Whew, I got away with that one! Then he said 'We need a new cuckoo clock.' When I asked him why, he said, 'Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said 'oh shit.' Cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another three times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted",0.78,Sexual Humor,Relationships Jokes,70.0,0.74,2.4000000000000004,21.0

uyiizq,"A man walks into a bar... He goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble. The bartender says, ""Sure, I'll take a bet. What's your action?"" The man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. The bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it. Laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. ""Double or nothin' says I can bite my *other* eye."" The bartender thinks it over. He knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet. The man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye. Now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. Just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up. ""Real sorry about that, pal. I get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so I'll give you another chance to win some cash. I've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, I can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. This is kinda hard for me to do, though, so I think it's fair if you give me two chances at it."" The bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. *Especially* knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. After a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet. The man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, ""Go!"" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top. The man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. However, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end. Catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. Once again, he shouts, ""Go!"" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar. Once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. However, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass. Head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made. All of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams **""Fuck!""** at the top of his lungs. The bartender mutters aloud, ""I wonder what his problem is.""

In order to find the bravest, mightiest, most valiant man in the Kingdom (and perhaps cull out a few of the weaker ones), the King decided to host a challenge. He invited the *entire* Kingdom to gather around a large pool that he filled with snakes, alligators, eels, and every other kind of danger he could imagine. He announced that the first man to successfully swim across the entire pool would inherit his Kingdom, his throne, and his daughter's hand in marriage. Before he could even finish his sentence there was a loud ***SPLASH*** and every one *gasped* at once. All that could be seen were arms and legs rolling across the surface of the water as a blur swam faster than anyone had *ever seen.* Finally, after nearly a minute of frantic swimming, out popped a **dwarf**, only 3 and a half feet tall. Everyone was *shocked.* As the regal King approached the man, he stared in amazement. *""What a mighty man this must be!""* he thought to himself. The dwarf was hunched over, hands on his knees, gasping and huffing and puffing and trying to catch his breath. The King said, ""Sir!! That was the most amazing thing I have seen in my entire life! I knew this challenge would reveal who the bravest, mightiest, most valiant man in all the Kingdom is! And even *more so* for a man of your short stature! Please! do you have anything to say?""

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to torment the bird we really didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again. Because i didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, i explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away. ""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

He had enough of that dog-eat-dog lifestyle, the stress, the non-stop rat race of NYC, the constantly fluctuating stock market, and his many irate clients. So, he decided to leave New York and buy a cabin in a remote part of the Adirondacks where his closest neighbor was miles away on a neighboring mountain. Pure solitude, nature, zero cell phone service, no electricity, exactly what he wanted Months passed and he had zero contact with anyone. He liked it, but he was getting a bit lonely. One day his neighbor from the neighboring mountain paid him a surprise visit. He was a huge, burly mountain man. In a gruff, but reasonably friendly voice, and pointing across a valley he said, ""Hi neighbor, I live on that mountain over there and I noticed that you're new to the area, so I thought I'd introduce myself and invite you to my annual 4th of July party."" The former stockbroker was thrilled at the idea of finally having a little socialization and gratefully accepted. ""Sure, I'd love to come to your party."" ""I have to warn you though, we do a lot of heavy drinking at these parties, they can get pretty wild!"" the huge mountain man confessed. ""I used to work on Wall Street. I'm no stranger to heavy drinking,"" the stockbroker replied. ""Well, I have to also inform you, there's usually a lot of drugs as well,"" the burly mountain man added. ""Yup, Wall Street. Nothing new to me, my friend!"" the stockbroker enthusiastically responded. ""And after all the booze and drugs, the night usually ends with kinky sex"" the mountain man admitted. ""Again, Wall Street,"" the stockbroker said nodding his head, assuring the mountain man he was an experienced partygoer. And then out of curiosity, he asked, ""So how many people are coming to your party?"" ""Oh, just you and me""",0.39,Sexual Humor,Relationships Jokes,26.0,0.78,2.8000000000000007,3.0

She comes, stands in front of him and says: ""Hi, I'm Emmy. If you catch me, you screw me."" The man is very excited and immediately starts chasing her. Unfortunately for him, Emmy is too fast and escapes him every time he tries to jump on her. After an hour, he is totally exhausted: the girl goes out and the employee returns. ""So, are you satisfied? "" ""Yes, I am."" ""Do you want to come back for the five-kilo formula?"" ""Sure!"" ""Tomorrow, at the same time?"" ""Fine."" The next day, at the same time, he returns.

She comes, stands in front of him and says: ""Hi, I'm Nancy. If you catch me, you bang me."" The man goes crazy and starts running after her as fast as he can. But no matter how hard he tries, Nancy is too fast for him and he never manages to grab her. After an hour, he has absolutely no energy left: the girl goes out and the employee returns. ""So, are you satisfied?"" ""Of course! After that, I have no choice but to come back for the ten-kilo formula."" ""Tomorrow, at the same time?"" ""Fine."" The next day, at the same time, the man comes back. The employee asks him: ""So, are you in good shape?"" ""Perfectly!"" ""Ready for the ten-kilo formula?"" ""Of course"" he says with a big smile. ""Let's go then."" As the employee leaves, the man can't wait to see the woman who is about to come. He imagines how she will be even more gorgeous than Lucy and Emmy combined, and he is already getting aroused. But surprisingly, no woman comes in. Instead, another employee arrives. He is a very imposing guy, way taller than him and bodybuilded like a champion. He comes, stands in front of him and says: ""Hi, I'm Jonas. If I catch you, I fuck you in the ass.""",0.64,Sexual Humor,Celebrity Jokes,2.0,0.56,0.6000000000000005,5.0

For those of you who have lived in Texas, you know how true this is. They actually have a Chili Cook-off about the time Halloween comes around. It takes up a major portion of a parking lot at the San Antonio City park. The notes are from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting from Springfield, IL. ""Recently, I was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. The original person called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the Coors Light truck, when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy and, besides, they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted."" Here are the scorecards from the advent: (Frank is Judge #3) Chili #1 Eddie's Maniac Monster Chili Judge # 1 A little too heavy on the tomato. Amusing kick. Judge # 2 -- Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild. Judge # 3 -- (Frank) Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway. Took me two beers to put the flames out. I hope that's the worst one. These Texans are crazy. Chili #2 Austin's Afterburner Chili Judge # 1 Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight jalapeno tang. Judge # 2 -- Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously. Judge # 3 -- Keep this out of the reach of children. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face. Chili #3 Ronny's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili Judge # 1 Excellent firehouse chili. Great kick. Needs more beans. Judge # 2 -- A bean less chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers. Judge # 3 -- Call the EPA. I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Get me more beer before I ignite. Barmaid pounded me on the back, now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced from all of the beer. Chili #4 Dave's Black Magic Judge # 1 Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing. Judge # 2 -- Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.\ Judge # 3 -- I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Is it possible to burn out taste buds? Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills. That 300-LB woman is starting to look HOT...just like this nuclear waste I'm eating! Is chili an aphrodisiac Chili #5 Lisa's Legal Lip Remover Judge # 1 Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive. Judge # 2 -- Chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement. Judge # 3 -- My ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from the pitcher. I wonder if I'm burning my lips off. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Screw those rednecks. Chili #6 Pam's Very Vegetarian Variety Judge # 1 Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spices and peppers. Judge # 2 -- The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. Superb. Judge # 3 -- My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. I shit on myself when I farted and I'm worried it will eat through the chair. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that Sally. Can't feel my lips anymore. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone. Chili #7 Carla's Screaming Sensation Chili Judge # 1 A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers. Judge # 2 -- Ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. \*\*I should take note that I am Worried about Judge # 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably. Judge # 3 -- You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava to match my shirt. At least! during the autopsy, they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing it's too painful. Screw it; I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If need air, I'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach. Chili # 8 Karen's Toenail Curling Chili Judge # 1 The perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili. Not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence. Judge # 2 -- This final entry is a good, balanced chili. Neither mild nor hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 farted, passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor feller, wonder how he'd have reacted to really hot chili?",0.31,Cultural Humor,Celebrity Jokes,5.0,0.73,2.3,1.0

So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high. *My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers. *How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday. He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense. ""Hello,"" the father asked, ""I would like to buy a cake."" ""Of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk.""

The couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from Alabama. The doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10. Figuring that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count. ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . .

Women always maintain that giving birth is way more painful than a guy getting kicked in the nuts, but how could they know? Well, after another beer, and some more heavy deductive thinking, I have come up with an answer to that question. Getting kicked in the nuts is more painful than having a baby, and even though I obviously couldn't really know, here is the reason for my conclusion: A year or so after giving birth, a woman will often say, ""It might be nice to have another child.""

Not long after that, the sorcerer is trying to impress a girl at the bar by doing magic tricks, and suddenly lets off a stray fireball, which sets fire to a table. The landlord rushes over, puts out the fire, and kicks the sorcerer out into the street. Then he hears a commotion over the other side of the bar, and sees that the cleric is drunkenly trying to preach to the other customers, who are angrily heckling him. The landlord shakes his head, rushes over and kicks the cleric out too. By this point there's only one of the party left, and he's staggering around, barely able to stand. Suddenly he drunkenly clambers up onto a table, knocking over a whole bunch of drinks, then pulls out his lute and starts singing and playing, terribly off key, causing the other customers to boo and throw drinks at him.

During high school, you both tried out for the baseball team and even carried the team to the championships. It was a great time for both of you. After high school, however, you both decided to go your separate ways. Liam wanted to pursue his musical career, and you had your own path to take.

You throw it over to him, and he says, ""Hey, I'll treasure this forever. And I'll keep in touch."" In return, Liam gives you the baseball glove he used. You both hug it out, and then Liam takes his leave. Five years have passed since then. You both have done fairly well with your jobs. Suddenly, you get word of a high school reunion coming up. Liam messages you, asking you to come to the event. Being nostalgic about your time together, you agree. On the day of the event, you decide to bring along Liam's glove so he could recognize you.

The boy then pulls out an additional $50. Then another. They repeat this until there is $500 on the counter. The receptionist, who doesn't make a lot of money, stops to consider things. There is more then enough cash on the table to oblige him and keep plenty for herself, and besides, she has no idea what this child's intentions are, and frankly it's none of her business.

Pete the Ballsack was this alpha bull and could have any cow he wanted. All except one. The one that always seemed to get away was Mary the Untouchable. To Pete the Ballsack's defence, she was kept in a barbed-wire fence encasement, so it was physically impossible to get to her. At least the one who was to get to her had to have a lot of courage. So, one day, Pete the Ballsack mustered up the courage to jump the barbed wire fence, took a huge head start, and actually jumped the barbed fence! Proudly, he got near Mary the Untouchable. Witnessing the whole feat, she said: ""Hello brave bull! Noone had the courage to jump the fence, and you did! My name is Mary the Untouchable, but it's just Mary for you!"" to which Pete the Ballsack replied: ""Hi Mary, my name is Pete the Ballsack, just Pete for you - the Ballsack is back there on the fence.""",0.37,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,100.0,0.79,2.9000000000000004,13.0

wyydh8,"Two guys, Billy and Bob, head out in the woods, hunting for bear... They hike to where their tree stand is, in the thickest part of the forest, set their bait, climb into the stand, hunker down and wait. Before too long, a small black bear comes by to check out the bait, and the hunters shoot it dead. They climb down and begin the work of butchering the carcass, when Billy's stomach begin to grumble loudly. ""Are you alright?"" asks Bob. ""I'm fine, let's just keep... Oh my god!"" Billy exclaims as his belly rumbles loudly. He grabs his midsection and doubles over. ""What's the matter?"" ""Man, I think I really need to take a shit."" ""Well, pop into the bushes and take care of it, I'll stay here and keep butchering."" ""Hey, man, thanks. I'll be back in a flash,"" Billy says, and crab walks into the bushes while Bob resumes butchering the bear. Bob slices away at the bear, peeling back it's hide, then pulls the gut sac out and stands up, wondering what's taking Billy so long. ""Hey Billy, I sure wouldn't mind some help out here! You about done?"" Bob hollers into the brush. ""Just a minute more!"" Billy hollers back, as he strains away. But Billy's bowels will not release, despite the immense pressure in his belly. Bob grumbles a bit as he starts working on a forequarter. He slices away, separating the quarter from the carcass. As Bob finishes the first quarter, he yells again into the brush, ""Yo Billy, for real man, hurry the fuck up! I ain't gonna butcher this entire bear by myself!"" ""Almost done!"" Billy shouts back, except that he hasn't done anything; Billy's bowels are as full as ever, and his colon stays obstinately closed. Bob grumbles some more as he moves on to the next forequarter, and starts to cut. Then he stops and thinks, ""I bet Billy's playing me for a fool, letting me do all this work while he pretends to take the world's longest shit. I think I'll help motivate the fucker."" So Bob gathers up the gut sac from the bear, and sneaks into the bushes where Billy went. He crawls up behind Billy, and deposits the entrails right behind him, thinking that the stench will drive Billy from the bushes. Then he creeps back to the bear, to resume butchering. Just then, Billy's bowels finally unclench, and Billy let's loose the largest shit he's ever taken; the movement rocks Billy to his very soul, leaves him with tears running down his face and gasping for air. Shaken, Billy finishes his business, and as he goes to hike up his britches, he sees the bear's gut pile. Shortly thereafter, Billy comes crab walking out of the bushes, back to Bob and the bear. Bob doesn't look up as he finishes the second quarter, just drawls sarcastically, ""It's about fucking time Billy. What were you doing back there, writing your goddamn memoirs? I'm halfway done with this bear, and I've half a mind to make you finish the..."" ""Forget the fucking bear, Bob!"" Billy interrupts, ""You need to get me to a goddamn hospital!"" Bob looks up and sees Billy's face, paper white and drenched with sweat. Billy is shaking badly, and holding his britches up with one hand. Bob exclaims, ""Holy shit, Bill! What happened to you?!"" ""I was having the hardest time taking a shit, you know, but I just kept pushing and pushing until it fucking blew. And Bob,"" Billy says, sweat and tears pours down his face, ""I pushed so hard I shit my fucking guts out!"" Bob's hand flies to his face as he tries to hold back his laugher. He grins at Billy, and says while trying not to choke, ""Billy, you dumb redneck, those were..."" Billy keeps talking though, cutting Bob off to continue, ""I managed to shove 'em back up in there, but you need to get me to a fucking hospital, Bob!

vo8hey,"Old Sven collapsed one chill November Saturday after chopping maple wood near his house in the birch forest, five miles outside of Eagle River, Wisconsin. He arose, sauntered home and changed into his flannel, tractor-print pajamas. It grew quiet and his breathing became labored. So, Sven lay down on the plaid-quilted single bed in the green guest room. His wife, Lena, tended to his care. He said nothing and sipped only a cup of water or two. On the evening of the sixth day, Lena looked out at the Big Dipper and then glanced back at Sven's furrowed brow. She sighed and prepared, touching his cheek. She found the phone mounted on the wall near the Kelvinator washing machine and dialed their three children, Ole, Karl and Ingrid. Over the next hours, they drove north from Milwaukee and Madison, gathering for a wake. Each, in turn, came to the guest room, sat down on the paint-streaked wooden chair in the corner and told Sven of love and of old times. He nodded and mumbled quietly. As the children talked and cried, Lena retreated to the kitchen and baked three-inch tarts with peach and cherry filling. She swirled a flaky butter crust across the fruit. As the tarts cooled, she dolloped a tablespoon of sugared, whipped cream on the golden crust. Miracle of Miracles! Sven smelled the tarts and placed his legs on the floor. He sat, stood and wobbled out the door. His gait grew longer. His pace faster and more sure. Sven ambled through the hall, down the pine stairs, across the orange, shag-carpeted living room, around the red dining room table and into the brown, paneled kitchen. He halted, stood taller and reached for the biggest peach tart. A wooden spoon rattled across Sven's knuckles. Whack! Lena pointed and shook her index finger two inches from his face. ""No!""

vf3mvk,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave. The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate. However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate. On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!"" Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. ""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said. ""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.

And this devotion to anonymity followed Tim through his entire childhood and adolescence. As Tim approached his eighteenth birthday, his one friend, a sheep named Bob, was adamant Tim needed to celebrate this milestone. It took much convincing, but eventually Tim agreed to make his first visit to a pub and experience his first taste of alcohol. The pub of choice was the Crown and Anchor. As Tim nervously approached the bar he bumped into a large beast of a man named Greg knocking Greg's pint clean out of his hand and on to the floor. Greg was furious. The bar went quiet. Greg had a reputation, the kind of reputation you don't mess with. ""What the feck are you doing wee man!!!!"" bellowed Greg. ""I'm gonna turn you in to a chicken Kiev!"" Tim, terrified, whimpered away. Greg, bearing down on Tim, suddenly caught the look of fear and weakness in the limp chickens eyes. Greg stopped. The pub was shocked because things don't normally end well when Greg was wronged. But this time Greg took pity. ""Now listen 'ere you scrawny little chicken! I'm gonna give you one chance. Sort me out another pint right away!"" Tim quickly sorted the drink and handed it, very carefully, to Greg. ""Now if I ever see you again wee man, you better turn and walk the other way or I'll be have a chicken chow mien for dinner!!! Now leave!!!!!"" And with that, Tim made a hasty exit. It took a good few months for Tim to leave the house again. Eventually he mustered up the courage to make his way to Bob's house to collect his belongings.

It was a female doctor notifying her that her husband had just been in a terrible car accident and was in critical condition and in the ICU. The woman told the doctor to inform her husband where she was and that she'd be there as soon as possible. As she hung up, she realized she was leaving what was shaping up to be her best day ever in the boutiques. She decided to get in a couple of more shops before heading to the hospital. She ended up shopping the rest of the morning, finishing her trip with a cup of coffee and a beautiful chocolate cake slice, compliments of the last shop. She was jubilant. Then she remembered her husband. Feeling guilty, she dashed to the hospital. She saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about her husband's condition. The lady doctor glared at her and shouted ""You went ahead and finished your shopping trip didn't you! I hope you're proud of yourself! While you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself in town, your husband has been languishing in the Intensive Care Unit!

vs0tsk,"A man is sitting alone at a bar when he hears a quiet whisper right next to him. Seemingly out of nowhere, he hears, quietly but clearly, ""Wow, you've got really great hair!"" Confused, the man looks around for a moment and sees nobody else around him and concludes that he must be hearing things. After sitting drinking his beer and snacking on some nuts at the bar for a while, he again hears something. ""My word, it looks like you've really been working out too!"" Certain that he heard something, he looks around again and finds nobody nearby. By now he's becoming a bit concerned and quickly downs the rest of his beer as he begins to question his sanity. As he goes to signal to the bartender to get a refill, another whisper comes out of seemingly thin air, ""Don't worry, you're fine! In fact you seem to have quite the keen intellect!"" With a final quick glance around him the man again sees that there's nobody who could be saying these things. The bartender comes over and sees the confused look on the man's face and asks if he's alright. The man replies, ""I think I'm going crazy! I keep hearing something saying random nice things to me but nobody else has been anywhere near me!"" Upon hearing this, the bartender smiles and tells him, ""You're fine!

Take out a blank sheet of paper and number it 1, 2, and 3."" The class, including Bob, hesitatingly does what it's told to do. ""What the Hell is going on?"" Bob mutters under his breath.

In a moment, I'm going to raise this curtain just enough to reveal the birds' legs. I want you all to tell me the genera, species, and sub-species of each bird.

The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible. The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him. After considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. After two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to G2's CSGO team, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.""",0.28,Cultural Humor,Relationships Jokes,312.0,0.9,4.0,39.0

The boy is so excited that he blurts out his deepest wish--to see how the owner makes his signature sandwich, a wrap with the most deliciously spiced meat the boy had ever tasted.

wh9hd4,"The Man, the Monk and the Mysterious Monastery Many years ago, a man is driving along late one night. As he's driving, he spots a deer in the road! In a panic to avoid hitting the deer, he quickly swerves away. Crash! His car smashes right into a tree, and the deer runs off. The man, a little dazed but miraculously unhurt, scrambles out of his now flaming car. He looks around, he knows it's late and he's going to get a chill if ge stays outside much longer. Fortunately for him, he sees a beautiful monastery! He runs up to it and knocks on the door. An old, wise-looking monk opens the door and asks the man why he's there. The man explains his predicament, and the monk tells him he may come inside for the night. That night, the man wakes up in a cold sweat at 11:55. He realizes he's listening to the most amazing sound he's ever heard! It abruptly stops at midnight. The man knows, in this moment, that this is his life's purpose. He's here for a reason. The next morning, he asks the monk what the sound was. The monk tells him he cannot say, because the man is not a monk. The man is desperate to know what the sound is, so he requests that he become a monk. The monk laughs and says the only way to be a monk is to know how many grains of sand are in the oceans, how many blades of grass are on the Earth, and how many stars are in the sky. The man, feeling resolve enter his body, thanks the monks and leaves. Many years later, a tired and haggard man approaches the monastery. He knocks at the door, and is let in. He tells the monks of his journey and tells them that the number of grains of sand in the oceans, the number of blades of grass on the ground, and the number of stars in the sky will forever be unknown to man; only God the all-knowing can know all. The monks approve this answer, and tell the man that he is now a monk. That night, when the clock strikes 11:55, the man and the monks proceed down a narrow hallway. They come to a spruce door held together with plates of iron. The monks give him a key, which is made of spruce wood and iron. They tell him the sound is on the other side of the door. He turns the key and opens the door slowly. There is another door behind it, one made of solid gold, with all kinds of jewels set in the shape of a pair of dragons forming a yin-yang symbol. He is given another key from the monks, who again tell him that the sound is on the other side of this door. He puts in the key, turns it, takes a deep breath and pushes the door open. The next door is made with a black material with shimmering speckles that he's never seen before. He doesn't have any idea what it is, but he is given another key from the monks. This key is of the same material as the door, and the key seemingly causes ripples in the door that appear when it gets close. He is told that this is the last door. The source of the sound that he has been searching for his whole life. It's right in front of him. He takes the key, and with trembling hands he puts it slowly into the keyhole. He begins to sweat as he turns the key. What will he find? Will it be expecting him? What if he's not worthy? He opens the door and sees... Well, I can't tell you.

ucj3hr,"There was once, in a small town, a man named Don. One day Don was walking on top of a fence, and he slipped. When he slipped, the fence split him in half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half of Don survived! Each half got up, started hopping away, and essentially started living separate lives. The left half, more prone to rational thought, spent most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting gig. The right half, more creative, picked up painting, and taught pottery at the local community college. On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of Don at the same place. Indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening. Now one day, half a man walks into a bar. The left half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him. At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back. As the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02. The bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident. As it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""Whole Don here for just one minute!""",0.43,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,50.0,0.78,2.8000000000000007,26.0

Follow same procedure as in 1, but hold cat's front paws down with left hand and back paws down with elbow of right arm. Poke pill into its mouth with right forefinger. 4. Retrieve cat from under bed. Get new pill from bottle. (Resist impulse to get new cat.) 5. Again proceed as in 1, except when you have cat firmly cradled in bottle-feeding position, sit down on edge of chair, fold your torso over cat, bring your right hand over your left elbow, open cat's mouth by lifting the upper jaw and pop the pill in - quickly. Since your head is down by your knees, you won't be able to see what you're doing. That's just as well. 6. Leave cat hanging on drapes. Leave pill in your hair. 7. If you're a woman, have a good cry. If you're a man, have a good cry. 8. Now pull yourself together. Who's the boss here, anyway? Retrieve cat and pill. Assuming position 1, say sternly, ""Who's the boss here, anyway?

Flatten cat's front and back legs over its stomach. (Resist impulse to flatten cat.) 14. Roll cat in towel. Work fast; time and tabbies wait for no man - or woman. 15. Resume position 1. Rotate your left hand to cat's head. Press its mouth at the jaw hinges like opening the petals of a snapdragon. 16. Drop pill into cat's mouth and poke gently. Voila! It's done. 17. Vacuum up loose fur (cat's ). Apply bandages to wounds (yours). 18. Take two aspirins and lie down.""",0.4,One-liner Humor,Animals Jokes,9783.0,0.96,4.6,112.0

The city block was unfortunately connected to the nuclear power plant, which, thinking that there was an attack, shut down the power grid, leaving the entire city without power. The military, seeing an entire city without power, wrongly assumed the cause was an EMP attack and counterattacked by launching their own EMPs towards rival countries. The rival countries, wrongly seeing the EMPs as nuclear weapons, retaliated in kind. And thus the world ended. Humanity was finished. 2 hours earlier... ""Hey, are you going on a date tonight?""

Short and round with huge feet, they were kind. They sang songs all day, drank, and made merry. After observing them from afar for many days, the astronaut decided to approach them and make first contact. Upon speaking to them, he found that they called themselves the Jibbles. The astronaut lived amongst the Jibbles for many years and found that they used a unique series of toe rings as currency. Unable to pronounce their word for the currency, he called them ToeKins, chuckling to himself at his pun. As the years went by, the astronaut learned of a war-like race of Jibbles. They came to his village and raided their supplies. They beat up several of the sweet Jibbles, and they threatened the astronaut. Months of this had the sweet Jibbles exhausted, and the astronaut hatched a plan. Taking all the gear from his spaceship, he snuck away to the mean Jibbles camp in the night. He met with their leader and offered him his wealth in order to buy a peace between their villages. Seeing the array of technology the astronaut had brought, the chief agreed to his terms. The astronaut asked for a sign of good faith he could show his village when he returned. So the chief removed one of his toe rings, took a knife, and sketched a crude picture of a jibble and the astronaut holding hands. This he gave to the astronaut. Returning home, the astronaut declared that there was now peace amongst their villages! The Jibbles drank and made merry and everyone wanted to see the gift from the other tribe. Late that night, when everyone had gone to sleep drunk, the mean Jibbles snuck into camp and killed them all. Turning over the astronauts corpse, they found they couldn't remove the ring from his hand.

w7s9dp,"A young baker buys a shop He is very excited as this is his first venture since qualifying. He sells ok on everyday items like bread, but runs into trouble with his 'special items'. One day he makes beautiful cakes, however his customers only want pastries that day. So the next day he makes pastries, but now they want muffins! When he makes muffins, they want tarts instead!! After a week of this he is very upset. He can't wait for people to ask for a special item as they take a lot of time and effort to prepare, and he isn't well enough known to take specific orders in advance. He decides the issue is advertising. If he can advertise his daily specials to the passers-by they will know what he has and be tempted by that instead. He visits a local signmaker to ask for a sandwich board, but unfortunately their chalkboards are in high demand and way, way out of the bakers pricerange. The baker is distraught. Seeing this, the signmaker has an idea. He has four smaller wooden signs that he can sell for a cheap price. Instead of writing and erasing one board, he can have all four and put a different one out each day. The baker agrees, and asks that the signs all be painted a different colour to attract attention. The idea works great. Customers can easily tell what specials have been made that day, and others are tempted in by the colourful signs. Business is good and the baker is happy. After a while the arm of the signs breaks (they were cheap ones after all) but the baker doesn't bother replacing them as they have become so popular with the town. They now know that Bright Red Sign means pastries today, even if the part with the lettering is missing. One day, a little boy is begging for muffins. On his hands and knees in the middle of the street, promising to tidy the whole house, everything for a muffin. His mother says no. ""But whhyyyyy?!"" he bawls. She smiles sadly and points to the blue stump outside the bakers. ""Because honey, this is his cake day post.""",0.81,One-liner Humor,Celebrity Jokes,12.0,0.93,4.300000000000001,1.0

She married him anyway, reasoning that sex would improve the more they knew eachother but it didn't, and after a year she finally divorced him. Having now been divorced three times she decided to join an online dating service and was very blunt about her preferences- she flat out asked for a man who would never hit her, never run off with another woman and be good in bed. About three weeks later her doorbell rang and when she answered it there was a man in a wheelchair who had no legs and no arms. He said ""Hello, I think I'm your perfect man."" She said ""Really? How so?"" Said the man ""well, I have no arms so I will never beat you, and I have no legs so I will never run off with another woman. She stared at him and asked ""Umm are you good in bed?

Thankful, the nun gladly accepts his ride and tells him where she is heading. This happens to be on the way for him anyway, so even better! The conversation on the way is a bit stiff at first you know, not really knowing how to talk to a nun and all but it eventually develops into a light, breezy conversation. They are really getting along and having a nice time. So the guy nervously decides to delve a little deeper and asks, ""Sister, I hope you don't mind me asking, but one thing that I've always wondered about is how you can go your whole life without having sex? Isn't that hard?"" The nun replies, ""Well, you know my son, that's a big misconception. We actually are allowed to have sex, we just have to follow 3 rules."" ""Rule number one is that you can only have sex with someone who is Catholic."" ""Rule number two is that you can only have sex with someone who is not married."" ""Rule number three is that it must be up the butt."" Intrigued, he replies, ""Well sister, I'm Catholic and I'm not married. What do you say.."" She gives him the once over and says, ""Ok, why not?"" So they pull over into a secluded lot and go at it hot and heavy, and have a great time. They get back on the road and eventually get to the nun's destination. She turns to say goodbye and sees the man is crying. ""Goodness, what's the matter?"" she asks him ""Sister, I feel so guilty, I must confess. I'm actually Jewish and married!"" he says The nun looks at him and says, ""That's ok because my name is Steve and I'm headed to a costume party.",0.66,Sexual Humor,Religious Jokes,17368.0,0.84,3.4000000000000004,713.0

vflf19,"The Watchmaker The Boy was due to meet his friends down the third alley from the green sign. The bar at the end of that alley, they had said, was a place where spirits and souls mixed together with the languid flow of warm summer air. But The Boy had started drinking when the sun was still ascending, and now it was dark, very dark, and he wasn't sure whether he had turned down the third alley, or the fourth. Or maybe the fifth. The second? But he could see dim light flickering at the end of the alley, past the shrouded grey cobblestones and the hulking black dumpsters, and with the light headed optimism of the young and intoxicated he was quite sure that he was heading in the right direction. He moved towards the light, and when he was 20 paces away he saw it to be a single small window, glassless, spilling a dry and irregular orange glow out into the gloom. His body had started to slow before his brain had time to think. A dull feeling of \*wrongness\* crept into the night air, mixed with the bitter tang that seeped out of the dumpsters into the warm air around him. Without willing it, his breath became quieter, his footsteps lighter, his approach more cautious. But he kept moving forward. He found himself drawn to the window, and such was the compulsion that it seemed to The Boy like he was standing still and the window was floating towards him. Like the distance was being closed whether The Boy wanted it to or not. He watched, detached from his own movements, as he came silently in front of the opening. His eyes pinched for a second against the glare of the quietly thrumming lantern that illuminated the room, then the soft pain behind his eyes receded and he began to make sense of what he was seeing. The window opened into a single small room that was cluttered with an incomprehensible multitude of instruments, many of them of bronze and leather, and all of them of a variety of shapes and sizes that seemed recognisably functional but otherwise alien. The instruments were arranged in orderly rows along the walls, but were so great in number that they also accumulated in disorganised piles around the periphery of the space. In the middle of the room was a square wooden table, and hunched over the table was a small figure. The figure was facing diagonally away from The Boy, and The Boy could only make out a weathered grey overcoat and the flickering suggestion of the wizened profile of a wrinkled old man. The figure was absolutely ensconced in whatever he was doing, and The Boy found himself irresistibly drawn to the windowsill as he squinted and craned, trying to see what the figure was doing. The Boy barely breathed in the warm night air. Everything was quiet. The Boy watched as the figure lifted a coiled silver spring from the table and held it up to the lantern light. The figure methodically pulled a pair of pliers from the wall and pinched it to one end of the spring. With a slow, fluid motion, he pulled on the end of the spring with the pliers and drew the spring out until it was almost an arm's length. The coils unfurled smoothly and silently. The figure lifted a square white cloth from the table and began to run it along the length of the uncoiled spring. The figure's motions were slow, almost loving, as he drew the cloth back and forth across the shimmering wire. After some time, the figure drew another tool, a simple metal shaft with an indecipherable inscription along its length, and began to coil the spring back around it. All of this was undertaken with an unhurried but incredibly focused fluidity that suggested true artisanal mastery. When the spring had been returned to a tight coil, the figure lay it gently on the table, and picked up a second, smaller spring. He reached slowly for a different set of pliers and then paused. His back straightened imperceptibly and he stopped. The air stopped moving around him. The Boy's breathing stopped. Time stopped. The figure began to turn towards the boy with what seemed like the speed of an hour hand on a watch face. The lantern light flickered across the figure's profile and The Boy saw on that leathered face the deeply etched lines of Time so heavy that it filled The Boy with empty fear. The figure turned completely to The Boy and The Boy was consumed by two huge black pupils, enlarged into grotesque caricature by a thick pair of gold-rimmed spectacles. The figure assessed The Boy silently, and after several eternal seconds The Boy found some remnants of his voice and managed to speak. ""What are you doing?"" asked The Boy. The figure's mouth creaked open, his tongue sliding across his top lip like an inquisitive worm testing out the outdoor air. The figure spoke. ""Just some spring cleaning""",0.33,Cultural Humor,Relationships Jokes,2.0,0.75,2.5,1.0
wn0gs1,"There was an old man who lived by a forest. As he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald.

It's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."" ""What I want you to do..."" the man continued. ""Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."" And so they did. Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.

ve2un6,"Ricardo was a young Italian man. He lived in Milan. On his 16th birthday his father Antonio, in a rite of passage, gave him a hunting rifle that was a family heirloom. The rifle had been handmade by Antonio's father who founded the Rolle Carabiner Company after World War II. Ricardo cherished the rifle and he practiced with it often. One day, while at the shooting range, he met a beautiful English girl named Nev and they fell in love at first sight. In broken English he asked her out for coffee and she accepted. Though she spoke little Italian, and he spoke poor English, they laughed and talked for hours. She called him Ric and told him she was in town for one week to compete in the Milan Shooting Championships. Later, the two walked back to her hotel, only to find her father standing, infuriated, outside the on the sidewalk. He yelled at Ricardo, ""Stay away from my daughter!"" But Nev screamed ""No Daddy, I love him!"" The father said to her ""Go inside!"" He turned to Ricardo and said ""If I ever lay eyes on you again, you better have an expensive present to give my daughter, or I will never let her see you!"" Ricardo went home and was very sad because he just could not afford to buy Nev an expensive present. Then he realized what to do. He took his cherished Rolle rifle, wrapped it in beautiful paper and attached a huge bow. Early the next morning, he returned to the hotel and knocked on her door. The father answered, and seeing the package in Ricardo's hands, invited him in. Nev was still asleep in the next room. Ricardo pleaded with the father to let him speak to her and give her the present. The father eventually relented and opened his daughter's door and called her name softly.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

However, the princess insisted every potential groom be put to a mysterious test of her design, and none of the suitors returned from a walk in the park with her.

wqcstb,"A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up So, he opens the box and picks up a letter. He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day. A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day. The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, ding-dong. Ding-dong, Ding-dong. The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb. ""Pardon me, sir,"" the mailman says, ""but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it's only going to end up back at your home in a few days."" ""Ah, my letter. Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. Please do so again"" replies the Buddhist monk. ""But sir,"" says mailman, ""you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now."" ""But that is my intention, dear man,"" replies the Buddhist monk.

The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way. Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monk's reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" The man says, ""All right, all right. I'm *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?"" The monk's reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, ""I have travelled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth."" The monk's reply, ""Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound."" The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is right behind that door."" The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, ""Real funny. May I have the key?"" The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door."" The man is relieved to no end.

wngo3v,"Ants with a plan This is a true story that happened in Africa. Every morning an elephant would walk to the waterhole and step on a specific anthill, forcing the little ants to build their hill all over again from scratch. By nightfall the industrious little ants would finish and rest up, and the next morning the elephant would pass by and crush all their efforts yet again. Hundreds of little lives were lost daily, they were unable to build up their food stores, and the colony was miserable. This went on for a couple of weeks until finally the ants had enough. That evening, after rebuilding their hill, they held a meeting. For hours they squabbled furiously over a solution to their dilemma, but by midnight a plan was decided by majority vote and the elders asked for a volunteer. Now, none of the ants, hardworking as they were, were in a hurry to put their lives on the line, and it took another couple of hours to draw thousands of straws, but by sunrise they had a champion. William. The smallest of them all. There was not much time left for the daily massacre to happen, and with the cheering of his colony in his ears, William hurried to the top of the anthill, reaching it just as the elephant stepped on their home, crushing it yet again. ""Jump, William! Jump!"" the colony called as one in their squeaky little voices. With a great leap, William jumped on its leg. Off went the elephant, William clinging to its ankle, and the rest of the ants ran to keep up, calling: ""Climb higher, William! Climb higher!"" This gave William the courage to climb to its knee. It was far up and he took a much needed break to catch his breath, but his colony, still jogging behind, called: ""Climb higher, William! Climb higher!"" Dutifully, William climbed up to the elephant's hip. There he paused to regain his senses, gasping for air. He had never been this high and could barely see his colony, thousands of black little specks down below, trailing behind, but he could hear them well enough when they called: ""Climb higher, William! Climb higher!"" Encouraged, little William bravely ran across the elephant's back, to its neck, the cheers of his fellow ants lending him strength on the way. The little ant crowd down below went wild! Never had a colony been so excited, and in a near frenzy himself, brave little William forgot the plan. Leaning down precariously, holding on to a hair, he yelled, ""What do I do now?!"" ""Choke him, William! Choke him!""",0.4,One-liner Humor,Animals Jokes,11.0,0.78,2.8000000000000007,9.0

v5tmvm,"I used to bartend for this popular place off a rural highway in my state I used to bartend for this popular place off a rural highway in my state. It marketed itself as a tavern, to get tourists to come in and buy a bite to eat, but the locals knew it by the name of the former owner, Pete. Pete had died a few years before I started working there. His younger brother ran the place, but Pete had a kid, Junior who had some kind of cognitive issue. Junior was in his thirties and didn't have much to do with himself, apparently, so he spent his whole day in front of a gadget that was kinda like a slot machine, except that its results were based on particular punch cards put into it by Junior. He was always changing his cards and cutting out new punch cards out of card stock, and that gave him a lot to do. He would narrate himself doing so, in a soft voice, saying to himself, ""Scan da red, uh. Scan the orange, uh."" And so on. He seemed to feel completely fulfilled in his day, doing this. Just playing with his machine. Again, the kid had some kind of cognitive delay, I don't know what. To keep him out of the way during the course of business, but also be able to keep an eye on him, Pete Senior had set him up in a corner where the overhead lights had shorted out due to water damage, surrounded him with pinball machines for the rare moments he got bored of his contraption, and otherwise the rule was to let him be. He spent many hours per day simply running through his little ritualistic, ""Scan da blue, uh. Scan da yellow, uh."" That was pretty much all he did. So aside from Junior, there was a pompous professor asshole who was a regular at the bar. He insisted we start a trivia night, and put one of the other guys up to hosting it. And then this pompous professor started winning all the prize money. I guess he really knew a lot of trivia, because three times out of four, he and whatever of his professor buddies joined his team won these trivia nights. It started really killing the spirit of the thing, all the other regulars were pretty blue collar guys, and they were pissed at how this professor and his buddies outclassed them in knowledge of everything but football, NASCAR, and automotive mechanics. So, I got a lot of complaints from the other guys. One night, though, it seems that this pompous professor's buddies got tired of the exercise, and none of them showed up for trivia. The professor said he'd play alone. The other guys pointed out the rules that he needed a team mate or he couldn't compete. I think they were hoping he would leave? But the professor just chuckled and asked Junior to be his team mate. The poor kid was never asked to join anything ever, so he eagerly agreed. He brought his punch card machine and sat in the trivia room, at the professor's table, eagerly popping in his cards into the machine over and over in his excitement. ""Scan da green, uh,"" Junior said, narrating his effort to put the green punch card in the machine. Then he removed it in a systematic fashion. ""Scan da aquamarine, uh."" And so the trivia game started, the other guys at least satisfied that Junior's shenanigans might distract the professor enough for them to get some points. Now whether from luck or sheer genius, the professor was still winning by the end of the night. It was neck and neck with a team of regulars who I was really rooting for. The two final competing teams were head to head, in a sudden death speed round. With that thin of a margin, you can understand why the other team would be giving the professor a hard time. The question was asked, ""Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are the primary countries in this region of Europe."" Ding! The Professor's bell went, and the game host acknowledged the claim. But before the Professor could speak, someone shouted, ""Junior is on your team, and I haven't heard him speak once."" ""Yeah,"" came another, ""he should answer at least one question, or else it isn't a team!"" The clear implication was that, if the professor didn't let Junior speak, he would therefore be disqualified. The professor was about to answer again, but the host was persuaded. ""Very well,"" the host said, and pointed to Junior. ""Junior - can you answer the question?"" As Junior was clearly absorbed in his punch cards, it was evident that Junior was likely not even going to have heard the question much less answer it correctly. To give him a fighting chance, the trivia host took pity upon him and repeated the question. The professor was clearly sweating bullets, and he sat there with bated breath, just watching Junior. Clearly he was expecting for his carefully made plan to backfire. Junior sat there a long time, staring at his punch cards. Finally, after some contemplation, he nodded and gestured to his stack of punchcards, and selected a dark blue one. He prepared it to go into his machine, and then pronounced: ""Scan da navy, uh.""",0.35,One-liner Humor,Relationships Jokes,26.0,0.83,3.299999999999999,1.0

vhqbkw,"Once there was a women's bowling team. Everyone on the bowling team was so-so at bowling, with the exception of two women. One of the two women was named Martha. Martha was absolutely abysmal at bowling. Every single game, she got at least nine gutter balls. The other woman was Linda, and she was the best player who had ever set foot in the bowling alley. Every time the team won a bowling match, Linda was responsible for scoring most of the points. Because she was so good at bowling, and because she was such a nice lady, Linda was very popular among her teammates. But there was just one thing about her. At the end of every single game, Linda said, ""Next game, I might be five minutes late."" Her teammates found it really annoying. She almost always showed up right on time, but still, she always said, ""Next game, I might be five minutes late."" The one who was most annoyed by this was Martha. One day, right after her bowling her sixth gutter ball of the day, she decided that she wanted to find out why Linda always said that. She went up to Linda just as she had bowled her eighth strike of the day, when she noticed something that made her forget about the five-minutes-late-thing. ""Linda,"" she said, ""are you bowling left-handed today?"" ""That I am."" ""I could have sworn you bowled right-handed at our last game!"" ""That I did."" For the rest of the game, and for each game over the next few weeks, all that Martha and her teammates could talk about was the hand Linda was using to bowl. ""She's bowling righty today!"" ""I remembered she bowled lefty at her first game!"" ""Could she be alternating hands?"" ""No, I remember last month she bowled three games righty in a row!"" Finally, Martha decided to ask Linda how she decided which hand to bowl with. ""Simple,"" replied Linda. ""I used to be just as bad at bowling as you were. Then I started dating a guy who always slept in the nude, and on his back. Now every morning, when I wake up, I look at my boyfriend. If his penis is hanging over his left leg, I bowl lefty. If it's hanging over his right leg, I bowl righty. This may sound strange, but ever since I started this method I've become better at bowling than I've ever been!"" Martha realized that her boyfriend always slept naked on his back, so she decided that she should try this method too. Whenever she woke up and saw her boyfriend's penis hanging over her left leg, she bowled lefty. Whenever she woke up and saw her boyfriend's penis hanging over her right leg, she bowled righty. This method worked surprisingly well. Martha, with her new hand-switching method, now got as many strikes as she had once gotten gutter balls. The team entered a national tournament, and Linda and Martha single-handedly got them to the finals. On the morning of the finals, Martha woke up and looked at her boyfriend to see which leg his penis was hanging over... but he had an erection. Now she had no way of knowing which hand to bowl with. When Martha arrived at the bowling alley, she once again asked Linda for help. ""What do you do when your boyfriend has an erection?"" he asked. With a sly grin on her face, Linda responded, ""Why do you think I always say, 'Next game, I might be five minutes late'?""",0.38,Sexual Humor,Relationships Jokes,28.0,0.92,4.200000000000001,3.0

uc834y,"There was once, in a small town, a man named Don. One day Don was walking on top of a fence, and he slipped. When he slipped, the fence split him in half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half of Don survived! Each half got up, started hopping away, and essentially started living separate lives. The left half, more prone to rational thought, spent most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting gig. The right half, more creative, picked up painting, and taught pottery at the local community college. On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of Don at the same place. Indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening. Now one day, half a man walks into a bar. The left half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him. At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back. As the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02. The bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident. As it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""Whole Don here for just one minute!""",0.76,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,82.0,0.91,4.1,19.0

Sam, curious, says ""Really Bishop, what happened? Everything OK?"" The Bishop paused a second, as if gathering his thoughts. ""Well, my son, it's like this, you see. I was on my way home from a banquet. A very nice banquet as it happens, a seven course type of thing with turbot, pheasant, port, all that kind of thing. Unfortunately, I was caught short. Very short. So, I had the driver pull over at the first bush he could find. So, using this bush that the Good Lord provided, I hitched up my cassock, and did what I had to do.

Gorbachev says ""no you idiot, George Bush is your father's son but not your brother!!""

The rifle had been handmade by Antonio's father who founded the Rolle Carabiner Company after World War II. Ricardo cherished the rifle and he practiced with it often. One day, while at the shooting range, he met a beautiful English girl named Nev and they fell in love at first sight. In broken English he asked her out for coffee and she accepted. Though she spoke little Italian, and he spoke poor English, they laughed and talked for hours. She called him Ric and told him she was in town for one week to compete in the Milan Shooting Championships. Later, the two walked back to her hotel, only to find her father standing, infuriated, outside the on the sidewalk. He yelled at Ricardo, ""Stay away from my daughter!"" But Nev screamed ""No Daddy, I love him!"" The father said to her ""Go inside!"" He turned to Ricardo and said ""If I ever lay eyes on you again, you better have an expensive present to give my daughter, or I will never let her see you!"" Ricardo went home and was very sad because he just could not afford to buy Nev an expensive present. Then he realized what to do. He took his cherished Rolle rifle, wrapped it in beautiful paper and attached a huge bow. Early the next morning, he returned to the hotel and knocked on her door. The father answered, and seeing the package in Ricardo's hands, invited him in. Nev was still asleep in the next room. Ricardo pleaded with the father to let him speak to her and give her the present. The father eventually relented and opened his daughter's door and called her name softly.

So one of the ladies approached Linda very discreetly about the problem, and told her to mash up some green astringent persimmons and rub them on her nipples and over her breasts, which should cause them to shrink in size. But she warned Linda not to taste any of the green persimmons because they are so sour they would make her mouth pucker up, and she wouldn't be able to talk properly for a while.

The next day, the doctor returns and orders another daiquiri, the bartender serves him, the doctor drinks it down and again compliments the bartender on his daiquiri-making skill. The doctor becomes a regular, coming in about the same time each day and ordering his usual daiquiri. The bartender takes a liking to the old chap, so he begins to put a walnut in the drink, which the doctor enjoys greatly. This goes on for months, and eventually years. Then one day the doctor comes in and orders his usual. The bartender realizes they are out of walnuts, so he puts a hickory nut on top instead. The doctor immediately notices the difference and says, rather loudly, ""what is this???"" Replies the bartender: ""It's a hickory daiquiri, doc!""",0.31,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,41.0,0.89,3.9,2.0

The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE. The Bishop was buried the next day.

ueldh2,"Dear Diary, For my fortieth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me. Although I am still in great shape since playing football 24 yrs ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try. Called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named Vanessa, who identified herself as a 26 year old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear. My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress MONDAY: Started my day at 6:00am. Tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Vanessa waiting for me. She was something of a Greek goddess with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!!!!! Vanessa gave me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobics outfit. Very inspiring, Vanessa was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. I enjoyed watching the skilful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today. This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!! TUESDAY: I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out of the door. Vanessa made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Vanessa's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. I feel GREAT!! It's a whole new life for me. WEDNESDAY: The only way that I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both breasts. Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to steer or stop. Vanessa was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members. Her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying. My chest hurts when I got on the treadmill, so Vanessa put me on the stair monster. Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? Vanessa told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life. She said some other shit too. THURSDAY: Vanessa was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. I couldn't help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. Vanessa took me to work out with dumbbells. When she was not looking, I ran and hid in the men's room. She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine. FRIDAY: I hate that bitch Vanessa more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. Stupid, skinny, anaemic little cheerleader. If there were a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it. Vanessa wanted me to work on my triceps - I don't have any triceps! And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the Barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher. Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director? SATURDAY: Vanessa left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my fist. However, I lacked the strength to even use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Shopping Channel. SUNDAY: I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year, my wife (the bitch), will choose a gift for me that is fun -- like a root canal or a vasectomy.

w0k4da,"An amateur birdwatcher and a professional ornithologist are observing the same patch of the forest floor. There's a break in the canopy above them, so there are dozens of birds congregated to soak up the sunlight. The scientist is eagerly taking notes and muttering to himself, ""282930 there's 31 distinct species all in this one clearing! It's amazing!"" The birdwatcher tells him, ""No, they're all the same species, some of them just look a little funny."" ""That's preposterous! Every one of those birds has a distinct colorationsome are blue or purple or green, for God's sakeyou're telling me those are ALL varieties of sparrow or something?"" ""No, not sparrows, they're robins. I guarantee it."" They argued back and forth like this for several minutes until the scientist decides to carefully move closer to the birds to get a better look and prove the birdwatcher wrong. He moves slowly to keep from scaring the birds away, and is shocked when he gets right to the edge of the sunlit clearing. Despite their differences, each bird has a red belly and the head and beak shape of a common robin. He returns to the birdwatcher, dumbfounded, and asks, ""How could you have possibly known that?"" ""It's easy,"" he says. ""Basking robins come in 31 flavors.""",0.56,Cultural Humor,Animals Jokes,21.0,0.8,3.0,4.0

ucx6xb,"So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living. He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it.

x1xjad,"Once there was a women's bowling team. Everyone on the bowling team was so-so at bowling, with the exception of two women. One of the two women was named Martha. Martha was absolutely abysmal at bowling. Every single game, she got at least nine gutter balls. The other woman was Linda, and she was the best player who had ever set foot in the bowling alley. Every time the team won a bowling match, Linda was responsible for scoring most of the points. Because she was so good at bowling, and because she was such a nice lady, Linda was very popular among her teammates. But there was just one thing about her. At the end of every single game, Linda said, ""Next game, I might be five minutes late."" Her teammates found it really annoying. She almost always showed up right on time, but still, she always said, ""Next game, I might be five minutes late."" The one who was most annoyed by this was Martha. One day, right after her bowling her sixth gutter ball of the day, she decided that she wanted to find out why Linda always said that. She went up to Linda just as she had bowled her eighth strike of the day, when she noticed something that made her forget about the five-minutes-late-thing. ""Linda,"" she said, ""are you bowling left-handed today?"" ""That I am."" ""I could have sworn you bowled right-handed at our last game!"" ""That I did."" For the rest of the game, and for each game over the next few weeks, all that Martha and her teammates could talk about was the hand Linda was using to bowl. ""She's bowling righty today!"" ""I remembered she bowled lefty at her first game!"" ""Could she be alternating hands?"" ""No, I remember last month she bowled three games righty in a row!"" Finally, Martha decided to ask Linda how she decided which hand to bowl with. ""Simple,"" replied Linda. ""I used to be just as bad at bowling as you were. Then I started dating a guy who always slept in the nude, and on his back. Now every morning, when I wake up, I look at my boyfriend. If his penis is hanging over his left leg, I bowl lefty. If it's hanging over his right leg, I bowl righty. This may sound strange, but ever since I started this method I've become better at bowling than I've ever been!"" Martha realized that her boyfriend always slept naked on his back, so she decided that she should try this method too. Whenever she woke up and saw her boyfriend's penis hanging over his left leg, she bowled lefty. Whenever she woke up and saw her boyfriend's penis hanging over his right leg, she bowled righty. This method worked surprisingly well. Martha, with her new hand-switching method, now got as many strikes as she had once gotten gutter balls. The team entered a national tournament, and Linda and Martha single-handedly got them to the finals. On the morning of the finals, Martha woke up and looked at her boyfriend to see which leg his penis was hanging over... but he had an erection. Now she had no way of knowing which hand to bowl with. When Martha arrived at the bowling alley, she once again asked Linda for help. ""What do you do when your boyfriend has an erection?"" he asked. With a sly grin on her face, Linda responded, ""Why do you think I always say, 'Next game, I might be five minutes late'?""",0.44,Sexual Humor,Relationships Jokes,2607.0,0.9,4.0,211.0

So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.

wwz1zz,"Most ridiculous advice my Teacher gave me ""Pay attention in math class because you won't always have a calculator in your pocket"". Uhhhhh I have a panic attack if I don't have my phone in my pocket so who's the idiot now?! In 2022, I can get by without even a basic understanding of my times tables. Oh, what's that? The bank wants to know how long it will take me to pay back my credit card debt? According to my phone, 1,246 weeks. But also never, because I'm never paying that debt back. It doesn't matter if I'm doing sums with a senior citizen or a friendly neighborhood drug dealer, my phone saves the day. Looking back, I actually can't remember anything I learned in 6 years of high school math. Sine? Cosine? Tangent? These mathematical terms are as meaningless to me as my relationship with my ex (who used her own mathematical formula of 'One Girlfriend + One Stranger's Penis = One Ex-Girlfriend'). Truth be told, I can't remember how to prove a single mathematical concept - and I don't need to. With my trusty phone I have a calculator at my fingertips and computing power far greater than my high school math teacher Ms. Green could possibly hope to display. This is partly because phones are so powerful these days but mostly because she died many years ago. Yep, to tell me I needed to learn basic math because I ""wouldn't always have a calculator in my pocket"" looks pretty silly now, doesn't it? I'm truly a genius with no equal. I'm a master of math that could make the majority of human civilisations tremble with my calculating might. I'm a God of numbers who oh damn, my phone battery died.

As soon as the plane landed they headed for a store and bought some really outrageous shorts, shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc. The next morning they went to the beach dressed in their 'tourist' garb. They were sitting on the beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a drop-dead gorgeous blonde in a bikini came walking straight towards them. They couldn't help but stare. As the blonde passed them she smiled and said 'Good morning, Father,' and 'Good morning, Father.', nodding and addressing each of them individually, then she passed on by. They were both stunned. How in the world did she know they were priests? So the next day, they went back to the store and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them! Once again, in their new attire, they settled down in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine. After a little while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a different colored bikini, taking her sweet time, came walking toward them.

vjtq60,"An old man was roaming the desert when he reached a village... Last year on my first cake day, I shared one of my grandmother's long jokes. I think of making it a tradition, so here's another: An old man was walking in the Sahara desert with his donkey when he reached a village. The people welcomed him with everything they could, offering him hospitality, taking care of his donkey, and feeding him. While having dinner, he was surprised to be offered camel milk, as it is of notoriously bad taste. He thus asked about it and was told that the village has been cursed with an everlasting drought, and that the people have resorted to saving however little water they could find for crops. ""Truth be told, I am one of the wise."", he said, ""I know how to bring you rain. However, you must first bring me a wide bucket full of water, for I need some to bring more."" The next morning, all of the villagers heard of his saying, and started collecting every drop of water they still had in reserve. In the end, there was barely enough to qualify for a bucket, and they gave it to the man. He then took the water, and walked within his host's house. There, he took off his dirty clothes, and started washing them. A curious one of the kids saw him through the window, and went on to alert everyone around. By the time they arrived, angry and shouting, it was already too late. The old man was hanging his last piece of cloth to dry. ""Shame! Shame on you, old hag, for wasting our water when our kids don't have enough to drink!"" said the chief. But as soon as he finished speaking, the sky darkened as the clouds gathered around the village. It rained for 7 days and 7 nights. People got their fill, and everyone's reserves were overflowing. The old man was treated as a guest of honor, and a hero, and the chief apologised profusely for ever doubting him. Only when he was about to leave, had the kid gathered the courage to ask about how he did it. ""It's simple"" said the old man ""It's always when I hang my clothes to dry""",0.7,Cultural Humor,Bar Jokes,19.0,0.79,2.9000000000000004,10.0

vqozfu,"Joke of the Day: HELL EXPLAINED BY CHEMISTRY STUDENT The following is an actual question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid term. The answer by one student was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well : Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following: 'First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today'. 'Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people cannot belong to more than one religion at a time, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities: 1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. 2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the postulate given to me by Theresa during my Freshman year that. 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct...leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting 'Oh my God.'

Dealing with the issue isn't as easy as it sounds, though, because any action that we take has the potential to affect good-faith users. Still, we've been discussing the problem, and we've come up with the beginnings of a solution: We're going to ban every last one of our subscribers. Just kidding! In fact, we're going to give you a bit more insight into how spammers work, what their goals are, and why they're so effective on Reddit. This information will be included on [our complete rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/wiki/index), which we've also streamlined and updated.

We'll be taking some other anti-spam actions behind the scenes, so rest assured, we aren't trying to dump the spam-fighting on you.

uosy8l,"There was once a Japanese man named Fuk Perhaps due to his unfortunate name, and the trouble it brought, he had a great love of alcohol, particularly the rice wine Sake. Every day he would drink an entire bottle from his special stash that was rumoured to contain hundreds upon hundreds of bottles. Tragedy struck however, upon finishing his daily bottle Fuk succumbed to alcohol poisoning, leaving behind his vast supply of drink and a not unreasonable amount of money. Being a man with little time for family, he had no wife or children to whom his inheritance would go and only his little old mother and two brothers attended the funeral. To make matters worse, he had left no will, as he had died so suddenly. Of course, this caused confusion, and one day the brothers met to decide what should be done. One brother began the conversation. ""So, you are aware that on his passing Fuk left behind all of his drink?"" ""Yes, and I think I would very much like that. Take the money if you wish, I do not need it."" At this, the first brother scoffed. ""I was going to say the same, brother. How are we to settle this?"" And the second proposed an idea. Since they were both men of the mind so to speak, they decided to play a game of chess to make the choice of who received the coveted sake. They sat down, and began to play. Their mother arrived, and seeing the two brothers in such a frenzy of competition, she spoke. ""Boys, what is going on?"" The first brother looks over, saying ""A competition mother."" She waits and watches as the brothers make their moves in silence. Eventually, she strikes up the nerve to speak again. ""Why must you compete so, right after the death of your brother? Have you no shame?"" The second brother turns his head, ripping his eyes away from the game for a precious second. ""We are vying for what we may inherit, mother, now please be silent and allow us our thoughts."" The brothers continued to play, getting more and more stressed. Beads of sweat fell down the face of each, backs hunched towards the board, eyes locked to the pieces in confrontation. Eventually, the game is nearly won, and both are in a position to take the other. Their mother pipes up a third time, just as the first brother is about to move. ""What are you even competing for, that is so important you must fight so?"" The first brother's hand slips, misplacing his queen, and the second brother cries out in triumph, putting his king in checkmate. The first brother turns, and stares at her.

vocc5f,"A calligrapher died peacefully in his sleep. He soon woke up in a land of paradise. He spent the next few days exploring. Heaven was exactly as he imaginedpristine rolling hills, golden castles upon cloud tops, reunions with lost loved ones, and endless opportunities to explore one's hobbies. He had access to the finest selection of inks and paper, so he continued to hone his craft even in death. The calligrapher would rotate his time between practicing his calligraphy and exploring what more Heaven had to offer. At some point, however, he noticed something: no matter where he went, no matter what activity he engaged in, he saw no angels fluttering about. It was strange, he thought, that everything else he was told about Heaven ended up being true, but angels were such a strong point of emphasis in the scripture! He asked around, and no other resident had seen any angels either. He continued about his days as normal, but he couldn't help but be bothered by this small detail. How could every other aspect of Heaven be real, but not the entities that were supposed to chaperone it? As he pondered, he suddenly heard a knock on the door. ""Who is it?"" he asked, somewhat annoyed. ""It is I, God!"" said He on the other side. The calligrapher hurriedly opened the door. ""Oh my... You! I'm so sorry! I didn't know."" ""It is all right, my son,"" God said. ""I am only here to check on you. I like to meet with all of our new residents after they've settled in!"" ""It's an honor, truly!"" said the calligrapher. ""I'm a huge fan of Your work."" God gave a hearty laugh. ""And I, yours! I'm always impressed by the craftsmanship of all My children. You know, they say that when an artist gets entrenched in their craft, it is as though they are experiencing a slice of Heaven in that moment."" The man thought for a second. ""You know, I'd be inclined to agree!"" ""So, I suppose the inverse is true, is it not?"" said God. ""Doesn't Heaven remind you of the most beautiful scripts you can imagine?"" He hesitated to respond. ""I'm not sure about that..."" God looked surprised. ""What is wrong, my child?"" He asked. The calligrapher sighed. ""Well, Heaven is great and all, but it's sans seraph.""",0.78,Dad Humor,Religious Jokes,4.0,0.83,3.299999999999999,1.0
wtv29p,"Brian's Eggs Brian came home from the pub late one Friday evening stinking drunk, as he often did, and crept into bed beside his wife who was already asleep. He gave her a peck on the cheek and fell fast asleep. When Brian awoke a few hours later he found a strange man was standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe. ""Who the hell are you?"" demanded Brian, ""and what are you doing in my bedroom?"" The mysterious Man answered, ""This isn't your bedroom, and I'm St Peter"". Brian was stunned ""You mean I'm dead!!! That can't be, I have so much to live for, I haven't said goodbye to my family.... you've got to send me back straight away."" St. Peter replied, ""Yes you can be reincarnated, but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen."" Brian began to consider his options. He was devasted, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen. A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking the ground..""This ain't so bad,"" he thought, until he felt this strange feeling welling up inside him. The farmyard rooster strolled over and said, ""so you're the new hen, how are you enjoying your first day here?"" ""It's not so bad,"" replied Brian, ""but I have this strange feeling inside like I'm about to explode"". ""You're ovulating,"" explained the rooster, ""don't tell me you've never laid an egg before."" ""Never,"" replied Brian ""Well just relax and let it happen."" So Brian focussed on his breathe and relaxed, and after a few uncomfortable seconds an egg popped out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him. His emotions even got the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him... ever!!! The joy kept coming, and as he was just about to lay his third egg he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shouting, ""Brian! Wake up you drunken bastard, you're shitting the bed!""",0.51,One-liner Humor,Animals Jokes,21.0,0.79,2.9000000000000004,5.0

After getting pressured by our families, we decided to look into the gender of our future newborn (they want to get appropriate gifts and what not). My party planner cousin wanted to throw us a gender reveal party which we agreed to. After a few weeks of anticipation, we had our party. We cut into the cake and found out we were having a boy! Now we started getting gifts but the looming question is ""what are you going to name him???"" Well 5 weeks ago my wife and I started talking about names. I blanked. I wanted something traditional from my German background and she wanted something more main stream as we live in the US. But we never could decide on anything. Days go by. Then weeks. Now we are just days away from the birth; go bag is packed, arrangements for dogs were made, and we are just waiting for the birth. Oh, but no name still. We decide we will make it a ""game time call"" as you Americans call it. To the fuck up. Well the day of the birth comes, and I come up with an unique sounding name. Incorporates what my wife was looking for while my heritage also shines. She couldn't be happier and our family loves the name. But something weird happened as we were being discharged. I'll be the first to admit it, my son has a weird name. No, not password security level weird name, but definitely not 100% 'normal'. I guess his name was being talked about by some of the nurses and staff. People starting whispering his name towards us as we were being discharged. Some patients may have heard it also as they started saying it as well. I go get the car for my wife, and we start putting our boy in his car seat and get my wife settled. Somehow people outside our car and in the parking lot were also saying his name. Almost rejoicing in it. Did my wife and I make a mistake here naming him something unconventional? It's been almost 2 weeks now. His name plus his pic must have gotten out there. Everywhere we go people yell his name at us. We can't go anywhere anymore without constant harassment. Like did someone put an apple air tag on him and publicly display his location?! Everyone always knows when he is in public. We don't know silence anymore.

She nodded, and he ordered a glass of champagne for her. After a while, he took another napkin, drew a picture of a plate with food on it, and she nodded. They ordered dinner, after which he took another napkin and drew a picture of a couple dancing. She nodded, and they got up to dance. When they were back at their table, the young lady took a napkin and drew a picture of a screw. The poor guy is still wondering how on earth she knew about his hardware store in Chicago!

ve3a89,"It was a bright, sunny afternoon on Saturday, June 18th, 2022. The temperature was around 89 degrees Fahrenheit. Mark, age 28, and James, age 29, were two men. They just finished a hard day working at the local bowling alley when they decided they should go to the nearest shopping center to buy some new clothes. The current ones they were wearing were starting to get old and they wanted to get into a new style. Mark messaged his wife, Anne, where he was going and asked if she needed anything. Anne, working hard cleaning the house after their two children, Mason and George, ended up tracking mud all through the house, let Mark know that she greatly appreciated the gesture. There were a couple things she needed for dinner that night. She needed Spaghetti sauce, noodles, and meatballs. Mark said he would be happy to pick those up for her. James, being single, didn't let anyone know where he would be. The two drove in their vehicles to the shopping center. Mark drove his White 2012 Toyota Corolla with 210k miles while James drove his newer, Black 2019 Volvo S40 with only 50k miles. After a quick drive, they made it to the mall. It was a large structure, almost like a wheel on its side with 6 spokes, holding hundreds of stores within. There were stores from Target, to footlocker, Apple to even Applebees. A mall was even having a new addition being built, adding a seventh spoke. The windows were the most recent part installed it seemed from the outside. The two coworkers parked nearest to the addition, taking a quick peek from the outside. Mark noticed that the door was open from the outside, perhaps from a worker going in to finish things up. James thought it was a bit odd that it wasn't closed up, but then both men walked around the mall to go in through a safer entrance. Once they made it inside, they were met with a beautiful mall interior. High ceilings, LED walls displaying advertisements and store names. The two walked into the Target to look for some clothes that they were interested in buying. Mark had found a nice new blue shirt, which very nicely complimented his blue Air Force Ones. James found a cool branded t shirt, so cool that it was almost as if he had taken it out of a refrigerator. As they brought their clothes up to the counter, Mark remembered that he had told his wife he would get her the dinner supplies. He ran to the grocery aisle and grabbed the spaghetti sauce and the noodles. He then quickly met back up with James to pay for their items. On the way, Mark grabbed a charger for his credit card. It was starting to get low on battery. Once they scanned all of their items, Mark charged his credit card. Overall it wasn't a bad price. The two men, bags in hand, walked out of the mall towards their cars. After Mark loaded the bags into his car, he came to a realization! HE FORGOT THE MEATBALLS! He was already exhausted from his day at work and walking already into the mall once. Now he had to do it again. James mentioned that perhaps they could take a shortcut by going through the under construction addition. Mark wasn't so sure that would be a good idea, as it could be dangerous. His friend assured him that as long as they are careful, they could save a lot of time. Plus it might be cool to see the inside. Mark reluctantly agreed. The two ran towards the door, except it wasn't open all the way. In fact it wasn't a door at all anymore. Now it was ajar. Mark picked it up, figuring maybe his wife could use it, as they ventured inside. To save time, they both began to pick up the pace in the dark construction site as they began to speed walk. Suddenly, WHACK WHACK. Then all was dark for James and Mark. The next morning, a construction worker ran to his supervisor, with an alarmed expression. ""Sir! I think we have a problem!"" The supervisor, annoyed and not even having drank his coffee asked what the problem could be this early in the morning. ""I found two men laying on the ground unconscious! I think you should take a look!"" The supervisor quickly walked to the spot that the worker was talking about. The worker was right, there laid two men, for heads a bit bruised, laying unconscious, but luckily still breathing. The supervisory quickly spoke on his radio, ""Central base, Ron to central base"" A man on the other end replied, ""go ahead Ron!"" ""Two men walked into a bar!""

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars. The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",0.8,Cultural Humor,Animals Jokes,4.0,0.7,2.0,3.0

So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high. My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers. How quaint, the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday. He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense. ""Hello,"" the father asked, ""I would like to buy a cake."" ""Of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."" The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad. The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.

After a fulfilling life with the now passed-away Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by from her front porch, with a cat called Alan for companionship. One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother. Cinderella said: ""Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all these years?"" Fairy Godmother replied: ""Well, Cinderella, as you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you three wishes. Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"" Cinderella was overjoyed, and after some thoughtful consideration, almost under her breath, she uttered her first wish: ""I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension."" Instantly, her rocking chair was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned. Alan, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch, quivering with fear said: ""Oh thank you, Fairy Godmother!"" The Fairy Godmother replied: ""It's the least I can do. What does your heart desire for your second wish?"" Cinderella looked down at her frail body and said: ""I wish I were young and full of the beauty of youth again."" At once, her wish became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years. And long-forgotten vigour and vitality began to course through her very soul.,the Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""You have one more wish, what will you have?"" Cinderella looked over to the frightened cat in the corner and said: ""I wish you to transform Alan my old cat into a beautiful and handsome young man."" Magically, Alan suddenly underwent a fundamental change in his biological make-up, that, when complete, he stood before her a boy so beautiful the likes of which neither she nor the world had ever seen so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet. The Fairy Godmother again spoke: ""Congratulations, Cinderella. Enjoy your new life!"" And, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Alan and Cinderella looked into each other's eyes. Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect boy she had ever seen. Then Alan walked over to Cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his strong, youthful arms. He leaned in close to her ear, whispered, blowing her golden hair with his warm breath: ""I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?""",0.64,Pun Humor,Celebrity Jokes,3.0,0.58,0.7999999999999998,7.0

When he finds his ball he notices a leprechaun lying next to his ball, out cold, with a goose egg on his forehead. Concerned for the little fellow he picks him up and is able to rouse him. The leprechaun comes to his senses and sees that he is well and truly caught. He tells the fellow, ""well lad, this is not how things ususally go but ye caught me nonetheless, and so, well, I've got to grant ye three wishes."" The man smiles and says well, I'm just relieved you're ok but I suppose I could use a few wishes. He thinks for a moment and says ""I wish my golf game would be a lot better"". ""Done!"" says the leprechaun. ""And for your second wish?"" The man thinks and then admits that he really could use some more money to take care of his needs. So, he says ""I wish for that, plenty of money to have on hand wheneverI need. ""No problem"" comes the reply. ""And for your last wish?"" The man considers for a moment and finally says, somewhat furtively, ""well, I'm a bit uneasy around the ladies so I wish I had a more robust love life"" ""Aye lad, that will be no problem"" says the little man in green. With that the two part ways. The next year the gentleman once again goes on holiday and is teeing off at the 10th hole of his favorite course. His ball slices, which causes his eyebrow to raise. Then he approaches his ball it becomes clear what has happened. He finds the same leprechaun sitting on a small tree stump just off fairway at the edge of the rough. ""Hallo there lad, that was quite a shot!"" The man notices that the ball must have struck that stump and bounced into the fairway with a prefect approach to the green. ""Well thank you fine sir, it seems my luck is holding. I've shot better than par since that day we last met. I suppose my wish had something to do with that"". The leprechaun smiles a wide grin and nods, then says. ""How is your money holding up""? The man replies ""well, whenever I go to buy anything, I reach into my pocket and always pull out as much as I need, thank you for that"". The leprechaun says ""well, that's all just part of the rules of the wish game but I am happy that you're satisfied"". Then he asks the man ""How is your sex life holding up""? The man glances around, blushes a bit and says ""well, I typically bed a lass a few times a month"". At this the leprechaun scoffs and replies ""good sir! I would think you could do much better than that! You made a clear wish after all"". To this the man replies, somewhat indignantly, ""well now, I'd say that's not too bad for a priest in a small parrish!""",0.34,Sexual Humor,Relationships Jokes,288.0,0.89,3.9,46.0

On top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of Don at the same place. Indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening. Now one day, half a man walks into a bar. The left half of Don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him. At 8:01, the right half of Don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back. As the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of Don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02. The bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident. As it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""Whole Don here for just one minute!""",0.76,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,13.0,0.7,2.0,50.0
vflgfh,"A Bulgarian man was a train driver He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. ""How did you survive without the bananas?"" he asked. The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",0.46,One-liner Humor,Bar Jokes,6.0,0.61,1.0999999999999996,1.0

I'll get you one of our loan managers."" ""Oh, great, thanks."" The frog grabs his little paper bag, hops off the counter, and stands aside to wait. Within a few minutes, a young woman of about 25 appears and approaches the frog. ""Hello,"" she says. ""My name's Patricia Black. I understand you want to take out a loan?"" ""I would,"" says the frog. ""I have an idea for a business, and I need some capital to get started."" Perplexed by, you know, *a talking frog with a business idea*, the loan manager asks the frog to follow her to her desk, and offers him a seat. ""Now, tell me what you have in mind,"" she says. ""Well, it's pretty simple. It's a computer repair service. I have a business plan..."" He opens up his little paper bag and extracts a folder, which he hands to Ms. Black. She looks it over, and it looks normal and reasonable to her. But still...*this is a frog.* ""Um...well...we *do* require that you provide some form of collateral before we can loan you the money you need."" ""I understand,"" says the frog, and reaches back into his bag. He produces a vintage Precious Moments figurine. ""This was owned by my great grandmother. She bought it in 1978, and it was the first one of the series. As you can see, it's in great shape, and has quite a bit of value on the collector's market."" Patricia is confused, but she wants to help. ""I don't know if our bank will accept this as collateral. Do you mind if I show it to the bank manager?"" ""Of course,"" the frog says, and Patricia takes the figurine to the bank manager's office. ""There's a frog out here who wants to borrow money to start a business, and he only has this for collateral. What do you think of this, sir?"" The manager looks over the figurine, shrugs, and hands it back to her. He says: ""It's a knick-knack, Patty Black.

The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the number was called. 4. After a couple of jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate. 5.

I need to ask you something. Have you ever seen a penguin? The man thinks for a second and answers that no, he hasn't. -YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A PENGUIN??? You need to go see the boss RIGHT NOW The man gets up, confused, and knocks on their bosses door, his boss answers -Tell me, what can I do for you? -My supervisor asked me if I had ever seen a penguin and then told me to come here -And?? -And what? -Have you ever seen a penguin? -No sir. The boss looks angry, and shouts -YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A PENGUIN?? YOU ARE FIRED. Pick up your things and leave now. The man tries to reason with his boss but there's no turning back, so he packs his things and goes home. When he gets home, he's greeted by his wife, surprised by his early arrival. -Honey! What's wrong? Why are you home so early? - I'm not so sure babe, my supervisor sent me to my boss and my boss fired me because I've never seen a penguin! -YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN A PENGUIN? I'm filing for divorce. Get out of my sight now. The man starts crying and as he is walking through the front door, his son walks in. -Dad, what's wrong??? Why are you crying? -Oh buddy, I was at work and my supervisor sent me to the bosses office, my boss fired me and your mom doesn't love me anymore, all because I've never seen a penguin!! His son looks at him, disappointed, his voice breaking. -You have never seen a penguin?? You are not my father anymore.

up5zdn,"the joke my gay elderly neighbour always told me before he passed away A man dies & goes to heaven. He's welcomed by gorgeous clouds & beautiful warm white lights. As he's looking around, he feels a hand on his shoulder. He turns around to find God, smiling at him. God promptly welcomes him to heaven with a hug & thanks him for his generosity on Earth. The man & God begin making small talk but one question keeps popping into the man's mind. He's very sheepish to ask such a question but he's dying to know. When there's a pause in the conversation, the man looks at God nervously. ""God? Can I ask you a question?"" ""Why of course! I'll do my best to answer it."" ""Well during my time on Earth, I heard many different things about"" the man brought his voice down to a whisper. ""Hell."" God smiled & laughed. ""No need to whisper my friend. It's normal to have questions. Ask away."" This made the man feel more comfortable. He took a breath and continued, ""Well, I've heard that Hell is full of luxury & insane rewards. It's a lavish life with all a man could ever want."" God sighed & said ""Listen, I'll send you to Hell for ONE night. No more, no less. But you have to promise to come back up after that one night."" The man agreed, I mean after all, he didn't know what was in Hell. Maybe one night was more than enough exposure. As nighttime rolled around, God asked the man if he was ready. The man nervously looked at God & replied with a quick nod. God held out his hand & the man placed his palm against God's. The man's eyes closed & suddenly he heard loud music. Upon opening his eyes, he was shocked. He was in Hell but it wasn't what he was taught in Sunday school. There was no fire or torture. There was no screams of pain & despair. Instead, he was greeted with a paradise. To his left was an endless bar full of the best alcohol, with a smoking hot bartender. To his right was a stage full of strippers motioning for him to come sit in a chair so they could dance on him. Straight ahead was a casino with slot machines as far as the eyes could see. He didn't know where to go first. Before he could make a decision, a stripper grabbed his wrist & led him to the stage. He was pushed into a chair & seven gorgeous women began dancing for him. As he watched the ladies dance, the bartender brought him a bottle of his favourite liquor. He looked around to see beds full of people making love. He spent the rest of the night winning hundreds of thousands of dollars, making love to the hottest women he could imagine, drinking the best liquor in the world, purchasing the most expensive clothes & finest jewelry, & meeting the most powerful people. The man was overwhelmed with the absolute paradise of Hell. But upon glancing at his new Rolex on his wrist, he realized he needed to head back up to Heaven. He was escorted to an elevator, which would send him back up to Heaven. Upon arrival, his fancy clothes were gone & the blasting music was just a memory. God greeted him with a handshake & opened his mouth to say something but the man interrupted. ""God, I don't understand why Hell is so great?! They have strippers and slot machines and the best booze and the hottest women and the greatest clothing and the best entertainment. Why doesn't Heaven have the same?"" God made a sarcastic face & tilted his head to the side. ""Now why would I have all that for just the two of us?""",0.58,Sexual Humor,Religious Jokes,,,,

""Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."" And so they did.
